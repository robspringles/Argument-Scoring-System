However I think the notions of fairness and punishment - whilst often useful - cloud this particular issue, and we shouldn't use them in either the for or the against cases. The more relevant issues are that they're Australian assets, that the current market is impermanent, and that the current profits are, historically, unusually high. We''re very lucky that we have so much of what so many people want right now. We're temporarily in an unusually good market for what we happen to have a lot of. Good markets tend not to last forever, and a tax on what are unusually high profits still allows a respectable rate of return for investors, and means both that the country has something put aside for when market conditions change, and that there's money available to help those whom this market disadvantages.

Punishment is the wrong way to think about a tax like this. Such a tax is a contribution to the good of the country, by someone who is temporarily in an unusually good position to so contribute.

Second, the tax allows miners to make 7% RoE plus the government bond rate before they have to pay any tax. 7% is well above the cost of equity for miners.

It is unfair that those just trying to buy a home are competing with those that have tax advantages.  This is an unfair playing field and would be fervently protested against in a less apathetic society.
The most dangerous thing about negative gearing though, is the way it encourages unsophisticated investors who think that losing money is a good investment.  That's only the case when prices continue to go up.  I wouldn't want to borrow money at 7% and get an income return of less than 3%.

criteria for this issue: one is the ""fairness"" of the level of tax on
an industry, and the other is the strategic advantage (or not) to
Australia. According to a Treasury paper by John Clark et al [1], we
should judge the level of tax by the effective company tax rate -- the
ratio of company tax to corporate profits.  I can't find the exact
ratios for Australian industry, but based on ABS figures [2] and the
Henry Tax Review [3], it seems that Mining pays a significant lower
effective company tax rate than other industries.  Even using a
criteria of a flat tax rate (which is debatable), it would seem on
this criterion that Mining should pay the extra Mining tax.

Strategically, we should worry that higher taxes will cause mining
investors to look elsewhere.  However, even the industry literature
acknowledges that pretty much all other countries are looking to raise
taxes to get more from their mining industry [4].  So, depending on
the level of tax, Australia doesn't seem to put itself at a strategic
disadvantage with the Mining Tax.

For completeness, my main concerns with the current tax are that it might be harmful to competition by hurting smaller mining companies more than large ones and that it will create incentives for and the additional complexity to facilitate more bookkeeping obfuscation techniques on the part of large mining companies to conceal profits, introducing new inefficiencies and further harming competition because big companies are better at legal tax evasion than small ones.
I would add that I think Matt's point that charging for profits punishes efficiency is a good one, but that having a bureaucracy decide on a flat resource tax would probably be worse because it could easily cause the opportunity for profit to fall below zero for some enterprises, especially the most speculative ones and it would be most harmful of all to the smallest, most entrepreneurial market players.

Having said all that, I think the current incarnation of the tax is probably a bad compromise, and should be replaced by something that makes better sense. I don't support its repeal mainly for tactical reasons: if repealed, it will likely not be replaced.

Whilst people may argue that now is the time to have a surplus so we can be better prepared for the future in case there is another GFC, it simply does not add up. The surplus has been achieved with the so called ""reduction of spending"", which essentially translates as social cuts and less money in the Australian economy. The consequence of this will be less money in Australian pockets and consequently less money in the real economy, pushing Australia into a recession. 

This is also being done at a time of high risk in the Australian economy. The dollar is high which makes the country not competitive. Also, China's growth is slowing down, which means a smaller need of resources, which means the Australian resource economy relying on China will suffer. If the Australian economy is to recover, the government needs to increase revenue (through taxes to companies with high profits) and to inject that money back to Australian pockets and to the economy. 

But we know, why that won't happen... because government all around the world are choosing to protect business and corporations rather than the individual.

So relative to more long-run sustainably productive assets in our economy that people could invest in the argument seems insufficiently clear why property investing ought to get a gearing free-kick. If the purpose is to make housing more affordable then it is almost axiomatic that a subsidy of this kind will in fact do the opposite.

It's about time we stopped being shackled by the hateful discrimination of the fringe-right and stand up for what is the right thing to do - grant equal rights to all Australian citizens irrespective of gender, race, religion or sexual identity.

The ACL's victim complex over this matter is completely unfounded. Jim Wallace claims that ""religious freedom will be threatened if same-sex marriage is passed"" - this is quite frankly nonsense. Under the proposed legislation it is explicitly stated that churches will not be obliged to perform wedding ceremonies for anyone they do not wish to, and thus will be able to discriminate freely within their walls as they always have done. To quote Greens MP Adam Bandt regarding the proposed Marriage Equality Bill:

""I want to be clear about what this bill does and does not do. This bill does apply to all marriages but it will also make clear that private religious organisations will not be required to marry anyone they do not wish to. This will mean that those churches or religious organisations that are not yet ready to change will be able to move towards change in their own time and in their own way.""

Furthermore, Jim Wallace's claims that ""there is no discrimination against homosexual people"" is pretty insulting, especially coming from someone who belongs to an organisation that demonises good, ordinary Australians as ""sinners"" simply for the crime of falling in love with someone against the grain of social norms. Jim I hate to break it to you, but the world doesn't exist to please your prudish sensibilities. You may not see the understand the appeal of men falling for other men, or women for other women, but that doesn't give you the right to heap shame and guilt on those who simply want to express their love for one another. It's this sort of behavior which results in the population at large using the word ""gay"" as a euphemism for ""bad"". You can wrap your hateful ignorance and discrimination up in indignant righteousness all you like, but to the rest of us can see it for what it really is, and frankly we think it's getting to be pretty embarassing.

Marriage is about love and commitment, not hate and exclusion. One day our kids are going to look back in shame and incredulity on a time when our country banned it's own citizens from marrying the people that they loved, and I will be happy to tell them that I vocally supported the shifting tide in favour of equality. When equal marriage rights are passed (and they will be sooner or later) the sky will not fall, your heterosexual marriage will not be any less valid or meaningful, and churches won't be crushed beneath the heel of the government - we're just going to see more smiling couples making long-term commitments to one another.

The recent polls have made it clear: the majority of Australian citizens are in favour of equal marriage rights for LGBTI people. There is no homosexual conspiracy or insidious ""gay agenda"" to fear. There's simply a significant subsection of our fellow Australians who are having their rights squashed with no justification other than ""this is the way it has always been"" rammed down their throats, and it's about time that this dark blight on our country's history comes to a close. I'm not some radical activist on the fringe or politics, I'm just a regular productive member of the population who happens to think that everyone in this country deserves to right to marry the person that they love - irrespective of what genetalia they were born with.

Opposition to same-sex marriage, is not always about religion. It’s also a social issue about what is best for ALL, for society as a whole - and the purpose that marriage actually serves. To paraphrase Anthropologists who have written extensively on marriage across many cultures and throughout the ages, marriage is a relationship primarily designed to encourage the birth and raising of children. It’s about bringing up the next generation in a way that provides the best outcomes for children in particular, and society in general. In terms of what has proven to work for societies since the dawn of recorded history, marriage is actually less about 2 individuals in love satisfying their needs, and more about providing stability for children and society once the honeymoon is over. 

Comments last year by Federal MP Deb O'Neill at the NSW state ALP conference need to be supported: “Regardless of culture, time or place, the organic nature of the family unit that is the natural consequence of the union of a man and a woman is a key social unit on which the state of society is built . . . It is a commonly held position in the broad Australian community.” She also is reported to have said that “people, like herself with a religious belief, who were opposed to gay marriage, were unfairly maligned as bigoted, intolerant, homophobic or brainwashed by religious indoctrination”, and that, “such a view is of itself intolerant”. 

But what’s wrong with homosexuals getting ‘equality' in marriage? As shown below, the same-sex marriage issue has very little to do with equality.

In the past few years, all legal discrimination against same-sex couples in Commonwealth law has been removed - something that even some Christian organisations supported as an issue of justice. As Helen Razer, a gay freelance writer put it in the Sydney Morning Herald (www.SMH.com.au, March 3, 2011): ‘”Same-sex couples are, largely, no longer discriminated against in law. In 2009, the federal Labor government passed a suite of legislative changes … The 58 alterations, to real estate, superannuation and sundry other acts, were a great win … for example, the simple dignity of compassionate leave is extended to a bereaved same-sex partner. This was a pressing civil equality issue. Getting hitched, expensively and blithely, is not.”

If one then looks past the Politically Correct mantra of ‘equality’, another agenda emerges. Michaelangelo Signorile (www.signorile.com) is a prominent gay American writer and a national talk radio host whose program is aired across the USA and Canada (He’s in the 2002 ‘The Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay Men and Lesbians, Past and Present). He says: “… gay leaders and pundits must stop watering the issue down – (by saying) ’this is simply about equality for gay couples’ – and offer same-sex marriage for what it is: . . . a chance to wholly transform the definition of family . . . gay leaders must acknowledge that gay marriage is just as radical and transformative as the religious Right contends it is.” Similarly, Paul Ettelbrick, professor of law at NYU and Columbia, and past policy director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights wrote: “Being queer is more than setting up house, sleeping with a person of the same gender, and seeking state approval for doing so. . . . Being queer means pushing the parameters of sex, sexuality, and family, and in the process transforming the very fabric of society.”

The happiness of two adults in love (or otherwise) – and/or their equality with others - isn’t the issue. If the agenda of Michaelangelo Signorile and others in the gay community is what is really being aimed for through gay marriage: “ … a chance to wholly transform the definition of family …” and “ … transforming the very fabric of society …”, then those who prefer families just the way they are should be entitled to a little more meaningful debate.

It’s a complex issue, and will there be agreement on both sides? Not likely. Will there be bigots on both sides? Absolutely. But please, can’t the rest of us discuss this in a civil way without hurling insults at each other?",,"",4,"",,"",,"",,"",4

Imagine for a moment that you were placed into a world where the men only sleep with men and the women only sleep with women, and if you cross those social lines then you are considered to be unclean, mentally ill, or some sort of degenerate. Imagine that your relationship with your wife or girlfriend is now considered an abomination, and the idea of your marriage is ridiculed, laughed at, and told by the powers at be that it is invalid. This is what the LGBTI community deal with in our society on a day to day basis. 

Now before you tell me that Jim Wallace (and hence the ACL) didn’t say this in the brief on the page above, read these articles:

http://www.smh.com.au/national/anger-over-rally-to-ridicule-gay-marriage-20110816-1iw1e.html

http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/australia-news/new-south-wales-news/2011/04/28/christians-turn-on-wallace/50564

The fact is that the ACL has been repeatedly accused of homophobic rhetoric, and thus they are contributing to an ongoing discrimination problem that persists in Australia. There is a reason that homosexual teens have far higher suicide rates than straight teens, and believe me it’s not because “there is no discrimination against homosexual people” as Jim Wallace says above. After all, what could be more hateful than telling someone that their natural, mutual love is somehow inferior or invalid? That sounds like just about the most un-Christian thing I could think of. 

Secularism gives us freedom of religion and freedom from religion. The ACL's interpretation of the Christian bible does not and should not apply to Australia at large. You may think that you aren’t a hateful person, but we’ve seen time and time again that what your organisations such as the ACL fear and don’t understand about the LGBTI community gives way to spiteful ignorance, and that has a very real and damaging affect on the 8.6% of Australian males and 15.1% of Australian females who fall under the umbrella of the LGBTI community in Australia. Hate born of ignorance is still hate.

[For that statistic, see: Sex in Australia: The Australian study of health and relationships, Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society. (Published as the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health vol 27 no 2.)]

Furthermore, the general scientific consensus is that two loving parents are more beneficial to a child than none or one, irrespective of gender. Please educate yourself on the issue here:

Perhaps it is the ""right"" to have children; or merely the insistence that one be seen as ""equal"" in the sense of the same, despite patent differences? Maybe we should be concentrating on these specific questions. 

Jim Wallace's point about the “threat” to religious organizations is a difficult one, since there are surely areas in which most of us would deny the rights of religions to practice certain things or uphold certain traditions – for example stoning or burning alive for things like adultery, blasphemy, apostasy, or homosexuality. But, given the clear difference between heterosexual relations and homosexual ones, there is surely a prima facie case for different codes governing their unions. We currently have that. 

There is also a genuine and important issue about the having and raising of children which should be acknowledged. Yet even here, it needs to be conceded that all too many heterosexual couples do a bad job of having and raising children; and it is not self-evident that homosexual couples would do a bad job. In short, there surely is a reasonable case for differentiating between heterosexual and gay unions, but it isn't because of God or religion and it is isn't one that should be advanced with a simple-minded or self-righteous assertion about child rearing.

Excluding a section of our community from choosing to marry, from that time honored symbolism (and lets not forget that marriage is a manmade symbolic act) of commitment because of their difference from that which earlier societies considered appropriate, is neither fair nor equitable.

Wallace's first reason is that homosexuality and heterosexuality are different, therefore they should have different types of legal unions, but he leaves it to our imagine to work out how they are relevantly different. (He does claim that homosexual couples don't complement each other in the way that heterosexual couples do, etc, but I think each of these differences would be denied by homosexuals, even if this was suppose to be a relevant difference.).

His second reason is that if gay marriage why not polygamy? But his doesn't give us any reason to think that polygamy is inherently bad. Sure, it's often associated with other sexist practices, but that just means that these other sexist practices are bad, not polygamy itself.  Also, it's a slippery slope fallacy because there just isn't the same level of demand for polygamy. 

Third argument is that not many countries have adopted gay marriage. Well not that long ago most countries practiced slavery. 

His forth argument that there is no legal discrimination against gay couples is his best, but it's only an objection to an argument for gay marriage, so it can only weaken the other side of the debate, not prove his point. This is because it doesn't address that issue that some gay couples want to marry but can't, and this they regard as unfair even if they do have all the other same legal rights. 

The last argument about religious freedoms is really bad, mainly because it's excessive vague, (which is disappointing because I thought this site was about providing brief and clear arguments for lay people who don't have time to do in-depth research on the matter) but I take it that Wallace means that if gay marriage is allowed then churches won't be able to deny marriage to gay couples. Well unless they have some independent reason why gay marriage is wrong should they be allowed to deny a service to people they don't like? Suppose a church was against interracial marriage, should we care if they feel their religious freedoms are being undermined by a legal requirement to offer a marriage service to interracial couples?

- Religious figures such as priests, imams, pastors and others could be sued for 'discrimination' or charged with a 'hate crime' for choosing not to marry persons of a same sex gender or allow persons of a same sex gender to preform the wedding in the religious institutions building (such instances of this have already happened in Canada).

Biology (understood as requiring sex differences) is not central to the making of an enduring and loving relationship.

Reform of the law in this area would recognize that a gender difference between the parties is in no way necessary to the kind of relationship which is valued, valuable, and worthy of social and legal recognition.
Since marriage is an institution of the state, there would be no requirement for religious organizations opposed to reform to preside over marriage ceremonies for couples who would be made thereby eligible to marry. Thus the argument that change in the law would discriminate against people who oppose it by reason of religious conviction is unsupported. The present law discriminates by arbitrarily restricting marriage to opposite sex couples; the state thus perpetuates and reinforces a devaluing of relationships between same sex partners.

I support the parts of both current Bills that say that celebrants should not be forced to perform same-sex marriages. The question of what marriage is in a given congregation is a debate for them, to happen at its own pace and to make sense for them.

But respecting religious freedom like this means drawing lines around congregations: they have the right to determine what religious terms mean for themselves, but only if they can't define it for other groups. If the Lutheran gets to define marriage for everyone, the Episcopalian has no freedom to define it for themselves, for example. Societies with freedom of religion, like ours, have to keep religious definitions separate from the state as much as possible for this reason.

So unless there are clear reasons why it will cause problems, the definition of marriage should be as broad as possible. That way, religious groups who want to regard it in a certain way are free to do so.

I've read all the comments here on both sides, as of 9:07am, 10/5/12. I can see that many who oppose gay marriage are sincere, and motivated by genuine concern for the wellbeing of society and especially children. I have no desire to call such people names: I share and commend their concern. I just disagree that same-sex marriage will have any particular negative effect on society or upon children. In my mind the burden of proof is on those who argue that it will. I understand that SSM opponents think it will, but I don't think they've made a strong case, or presented much evidence, to actually show that it will.

I don't find the slippery-slope argument compelling. If we ever get to the point where a significant portion of society wants to legalise polygamous marriage, or any other kind of marriage, we can have that debate at that time, and on its own merits. Personally I doubt that will ever happen. Until it does, let's leave it out of the argument: it doesn't help.

The arguments about what God intended are legitimate arguments to be had within a congregation of believers, but not good arguments about how to frame public policy. We're a secular society.

While I respect the conservative argument that one should't change things that work (unintended consequences abound in history), I don't find the arguments about how long marriage has been seen a certain way to be persuasive. Should we return to living in caves because we did it for millenia?

I'm yet to see any good evidence that homosexual parents are worse at parenting than heterosexual ones.

On the other side, it will bring a lot of happiness to a lot of people.

Intimacy in marriage is intended to provide fun for husbands and wives and be relief from the pressures of life, resulting in peace and joy between each other and in the home for children.

Conservatives and religious people argue that change is bad. That man and woman complement each other (talking explicitly of sex organs and therefore reproduction), and LGBTI people don't. Finally, they also invoke a doom scenario of slippery slope.

One of the few things that are certain and positive in life and history, is change. Change has allowed to get to where we are. If we did not change we would still leave in caves and still have slaves. We would still deny women the right to vote and work. We would still sideline and consider single mums shameless outcasts. We would still consider anyone a shade darker than white not much more than an animal. We would still have children working as slaves for 15 hours a day... oh wait, we still have that in some parts! Change is good, because throughout history, overall, we have managed to win civil rights, better living and work conditions, education and health. 

The argument that man and woman complement each other naturally and can have children therefore marriage can only be between a man and a woman doesn't make sense either. By that logic, should we rescind heterosexuals their ""married"" condition if they cannot produce children? Those who use the ""man and woman"" argument speak of tradition and most often conditioned by religious beliefs. Clearly, not everything that is tradition is good and most traditions have drastically changed across centuries. As society progresses, as we move forward in our thinking, a lot of tradition become anachronistic and sometimes barbaric. In terms of the religion bias. I simply cannot accept that religion have exclusive ownership over marriage and I cannot accept religious hijacking marriage and denying people rights.

Finally, the slippery slope, doom scenario, is laughable. The same words have been used for thousands of years in every generation. As far back as ancient Greece we can see philosophers and writers complaining about new rights, social demands, or simply criticising the youth of the time and invoking the slippery slope. We are still here and throughout history we have improved because we have changed with the times, because we have improved on civil rights, equal rights and justice.",,"",,"",,"",,"",,"",

It seems to me that the Church wants to hang on to the term ""marriage"" by using the law.  I'm all for marriage. I've been married to the same woman for almost 50 very short years. But the marriage I have was concecrated by the church and state similtaneously.  A marriage concecrated by the state is one consecrated in law. States make laws.  Churches make laws too but they are different and not to be confused as meaning the same thing.  If a couple want their marriage concecrated in the future in Australia then I think that it should require 2 ceremonies. A state marriage is a  non-secular lawful marriage between consenting adults (for ever if possible) and this is the responsiblity of the state.  The only priviso really should be those who get married must meet the lawful requirements of the state.   If in addition a couple want the blessing of a church then they can make that decision however it needs to be separate from the first action because I think one of the most dangerous things at play across the world today is the confusion caused by state and  church becoming and or remaining as one.   Therefore it seems reasonable if a same sex couple want to have their coupling confirmed as a marriage then the state can do so for them.  Whether a church should also confirm this marriage is not a decision for the state but a separate decision for the church.  Many gays may find churches unwilling to take this step but that is a separate issue and one the state should not interfere with. So yes! same sex marriage should be legalised.

->Illicit drugs will be used more by more people.

.. .. ->Those tempted to become criminals include police officers whose defection seriously undermines the effectiveness of and trust in the law enforcement system.
.. ->Lots of resources are funneled into the hands of criminal organisations.
.. .. ->These resources are used to fund violent warfare between criminal organisations that kill and injure lots of people (including non-criminals), damage property and substantially decrease the quality of life of all people in the vicinity of the conflict.
->It requires a lot of violence to try to force lots of people to stop doing something they really want to do.
.. ->This tends to foster general animosity towards law enforcement among members of affected communities, which substantially decreases the capacity of law enforcement to be effective in all areas of responsibility.
->It costs a great deal of money to police an activity that a large number of people are motivated to engage in.
.. ->This diverts resources away from activities that would have a much higher net benefit to society. For example, health and education programs.
->Drug use is forced underground and into less safe environments.
.. ->Dangerous practices with negative externalities (e.g. disease propagation) like use of and sharing of unclean needles are more likely in such environments.
->It causes corrosion of trust in the integrity of the law among people who feel unjustly criminalised for an activity that they believe (perhaps correctly for many instances of recreational drug use) is not harmful to anyone.

Just a few notes:
Jo talks of scientific research toward her position's favour with quite a fervour, but fails to cite anything.  
Many of her arguments commit the slippery slope fallacy with no evidence.  The sources she does cite are largely irrelevent to the position she then argues in her points, such as the link between the U.N. Convention on Rights of the Child and her argument that ""drug users"" (what drugs, Jo?) are clearly linked to child abuse.
I think the best point she makes is the point of Reduction of Criminal Justice Costs... but she vastly exaggerates this point too.  Although there are black markets for tobacco and alcohol, it is far easier for law enforcement to focus their efforts on this smaller section of criminal activity, than focus on the entire market.  To use an analogous argument (reductio ad absurdum) - should we ban all movies and albums because content piracy exists and creates a black market?  

I have also read several of Drug Free Australia's reports in my time, found them largely unfactual, misleading and lacking in citation.

Imagine if the cigarette industry were illegal, the police would not only have to deal with the black market in cigarettes, but the entire cigarette industry.
""Crime would not be eliminated or reduced"" - most drug addicts do not want to be criminals too, it is the addiction and the illegal nature of drugs that makes them commit crime; businesses manufacturing drugs would also not be illegal, and would also reduce policing demands, though they ought to be highly regulated, due to the dangers inherent in currently illegal drugs.

UN Drug Conventions have failed.
UN Controls are NOT working - the drug problem is much worse now than it was 30 or 40 years ago. We could reduce the drug problem by proper regulation, rather than giving carte-blanche to the black market to ""regulate"".
Not Legalising sends the message that organized crime is OK, and that the law and society are out of touch with reality.
Legalisation and regulation does not necessarily mean greater accessibility and availability. Potentially quite the reverse, by taking organized crime out of the picture. 
""Enforcement of laws ... discourage drug use"" -  well, since drug use has increased over the past 50 years, that's clearly not the case.
Prohibition never works. We regulate alcohol, tobacco, prositution, and gambling, because we recognize that to ban them would simply force them underground, and not stop them at all. We need to do the same for drugs.
""more, not less, control of their access is warranted...""  Exactly.  That's why we need proper regulation, which cannot be achieved while it is illegal.
""People are entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts.""  Here's one for you:  Very few people would die from heroin overdose if they knew what they were taking!  If they had a measured dose, they would not die. Therefore, reducing the impact on others. Like the advice on alcohol containers about the number of standard drinks, knowledge of what heroin users are taking will never happen while organized crime is in control - it can only happen through proper government regulation, just like alcohol containers.
Taxation: currently the tax take from drugs is zero.  Any increase, and subsequent diversion of income from organized crime, would be welcome. 
Protecting children: Yes! Proper regulation can do a much better job than continuing to hand this job over to organized crime.

The assumption underlying this argument is that legalisation means a market free-for-all.  

I don't believe that alcohol or tobacco are currently well regulated.  My idea of legalisation includes the creation of an entire new bureaucracy which would control recreational substances - including the current tobacco and alcohol (so they would be regulated differently).  This bureaucracy would look after education, research, tax allocation research, health research etc..  - essentially all the things that are split between multiple organisations currently.  
Legalisation is something that would require a lengthy discussion about how to regulate etc.. Decriminalisation only moves the problem along - although is a useful stepping stone, as Portugal and the Netherlands have shown.

The 'curiousity' factor noted I believe lacks evidence and is based on a presumption about human behaviour.  Personally, I don't try things just because they are legal.

they LAW is confused & blinkered regarding reform. although many in the judiciary & police are aware
it's a drug war no one can win .. in the USA it has turned ""PROHIBITION"" & Nixons ""DRUG WAR"" in to a massive people cannabalising industry.
with many interests who want to keep the status quo. profiteering private prisons.
competitive & far cheaper medicinal use blocked by big pharma , law enforcement who are addicted to drug war funding.
it's the ongoing drug war that some interests want to keep making mountain loads of money out of.

the common arguments are a long list indeed.
since when ever is it the governments role , to police personal use. of anything ?
to dictate to humans what they can & cannot do with their lives. their own bodies .
here's the most poigniant truth.. the law does far more harm that the Plant ever does.
which harms no one , there is no victim ,, it's a victimless crime.
there are no recorded deaths attributed to cannabis ~0
so called legal drugs alcohol & tobacco kill millions of humans every year , 
& cause tremendous social damage. & yet they are allowed. tolerated. heavily taxed & regulated
why , because alcohol prohibition failed catastrophically in the 30s . with the ensuing carnage.
& it's Prohibition which created the black market & made the Al Capones. mega wealthy. gangs.. guns.. 
& now we all live with the legacy of bad prejudical laws that were passed surreptitiously through USA congress.
the marihuana tax act of 1937 .. a completely falacious invention. 
what's worse is that they have armed themselves to the teeth
with the all accoutrements of battle , against a mostly harmless citizenship.
high powered automatic rifles , helicopters , etc etc.
with whom the USA persecutes & imprisons regular people at a rate of 1/4 of the worlds total prison inmates.
having only 5% of the worlds population... clearly something is askance & the
money trail , with the corruption , leads all the way up to the white house steps. a whited sepulcre indeed.
this all adds up to a political punching bag & a facade of justice. it has to stop.
get the law enforcement ouf of this & give it to Medical & Hospital care. all DRUGS.
 
if they prohibited tomatoes tommorrow. the day after , there'd be a black market
& the prices would be 10 times higher ..  ha hah !>. oh yeah more gangs & guns.
 
cannabis prohibition & it's failed/flawed strategy to keep us all DRUG FREE,
while legal prescription medicines kill thousands & disable countless more.
it's going to collapse in a heap. we should all push it closer to the cliff edge.
I will stand over the dead body of this policy & cheer !> in fact
the War on Drugs is already DEAD.. we're waiting for the stink to reach
the conscience of PARLIAMENT.
 
anyone who does a bit of research will find that history
has recorded all this for all to see. youtube drug war cannabis law etc etc. 
& yet . USA will not admit to it's collossal DRUG WAR policy failure.
Trillions... spent on an unworkable idea. that's the gist of it.
instead , they dig their heels in & fund more violent home intrusions.
home & asset forfeiture , blocking of evidence in court.. it goes on & on.
we are relatively better off here in Oz.
 
despite evidence & commisions & reports to the effect that cannabis should be legal ..
not to criminalise behaviour in the privacy of ones own home.
a 70s Richard Nixon ( Vietnam Warmonger ) strategy to win votes from 
a vastly mislead public. well Dirty Dick was a criminal & impeached
for his back room deals in watergate. now he's dead & gone , the filthy shit ,
but his tough on drugs stance , 40 years later , continues to wound & destroy many lives.
many times the USA law confiscates property , cutting the legs out from under people
who become defenceless & suffer the rule of law without hope or reprieve.
the USA is totally screwed & we along with many nations have to play along with their game.
hpwever , there's hope & a light.. many countries are revoking their treaty agreements
thumbing their noses at the bully on the block ,.. HEMP is superior in every way & we all know it.
in Europe & Latin America , they have found more humane & tolerant ways to deal with public drug policy. 
thousands of coffee shops in Holland , medical dispenaries in Califormia mushroomed over night.
Portugal Spain France Germany Italy Swtizerland Holland Belgium ,, 
all reformed & changed their approach. Zero Tolerance is for despots & Ideological morons.
 
USA dominance & influence is crumbling. Yaaaaay !>
damn uncle sam,
 
what we are fighting is a well entrenched & heavily guarded
policy of repression , ignorance & naysaying , when it comes to both
the free recreational use & medicial use of a very low risk substance.
we know , the quality of consciousness & how it's altered by it's use.
we know , the effect it can have of casting new thoughts far & wide , 
we know , that it will help us break out of mental conditioning to see things differently.
we know , the personal insights gained & the benefits of relaxing from stress.
the government don't want free thinkers.. that's obvious.
 
I am also outraged at this.. & have done what I can to make the change.. 
made public videos , posted  articles & responded to blogs.. joined groups
voted on issues & sent the message to many to be part of the change .. 
politics is typically a slow dull witted behemoth , 
that must be whipped into reform by growing public disapproval , it's happening.
tipped the scale recently at 71% approval for legalisation in USA>
before they amend their stupid laws.. common sense will prevail.
& the courts are hog tied by international treaties , with little ability 
to manouvre around , or discern it's own wrongs.
it's the PROHIBITION that has created all this.
profitable black market gang violence & police corruption.
Humanity has to get a conscience. time to get real.

There is a huge amount of cognitive dissonance in public discourse when it comes to drug use, and alcohol is the best example of this; it’s a drug which is addictive, contributes to social decline, there is an easily attainable overdose risk (alcohol poisoning), and yet it’s readily available and a celebrated part of our culture. It can also be enjoyed responsibly. It needs to be recognised that there are such things as responsible recreational drug users. Can you enjoy a pint of beer every once in a while without getting blackout drunk? Congratulations, you're one of them. It is exactly the same thing with cannabis use.

I think it’s time to evolve away from our knee-jerk hard line response to the drug problem, and turn to evidence based regulation (no sales to <18 year olds or those visibly intoxicated, no driving under the influence), taxation (additional revenue generated going to rehabilitation for addicts and preventative education), and compassionate mitigation. This takes power out of the hands of black-market dealers and crime syndicates, stopping the street-hard and heartless exploitation of drug addicts and reducing gang-based crime, while at the same time providing a safe framework for people to address their drug problems and receive positive support. Drug regulation also means purer, cleaner product, which will greatly reduce overdoses due to contaminated cutting and mixing; you’ll see a sharp drop in kids dying from things like dodgy ecstasy pills. 

Furthermore, specialised cannabis dispensaries (such as those that are legal on a state level in California) would reduce the “gateway drug” argument (which I think is a shaky one anyway) to proverbial rubble. The only merit of the gateway theory is that people who want to buy cannabis have to buy it from a drug dealer, and drug dealers often sell more than just cannabis; dispensaries would eliminate this pushing risk entirely.

Criminal suppliers do not ask for age identification and are not forced to guarantee the quality, purity, or even identity of the products they sell. In contrast, the government regulates the production, packaging, marketing and availability of alcohol and tobacco, just as it regulates cars and all aspects of road transport. Clearly, it is possible to regulate behaviours that some consider dangerous, so that mature, responsible individuals can undertake them safely and with benefit.

Drugs were not ""an enormous social and health problem"" in 1961 when the UN Single COnvention on Narcotic Drugs created the International Narcotics Control Board, banned Cannabis, and enabled enormous criminal profits. Prohibition was ideological from the start, and based on flawed research that was tainted by racist and ethnocentric prejudices.

50 years later, by all measures, drugs now cause great harm in every country. But by far the most harm associated with drugs is created or exacerbated by prohibition and the police, prison and treatment industries and criminal cartels that feed off the system. Prohibition has done nothing to reduce the risk of actual harms that drugs pose, like addiction. And the harms that prohibition has created - incarceration, massive corruption, violent criminal gangs, and drugs that are not what the dealer claims they are - are much greater than any harm the drugs themselves might cause.

Despite the real harms that prohibition creates, most white educated drug users are getting away with it. The heaviest burden falls on people who are already disadvantaged - black communities in the US and impoverished communities in supplier nations.

One more argument: a moral one. We can't grow up under prohibition, which seeks to ban choices we may regret: choices that challenge us to grow. Obedience is an immature virtue at best, and often very much worse.

I value my drug experiences because they have challenged me to grow and connect.

It is madness that people are being exposed to these dangerous chemicals with unknown potential for harm when other illegal chemicals that they are mimicking are less harmful (often less harmful than alcohol). 

What is required is a rationale approach to drug policy. Within such a policy the amount of restriction placed on a substance would be directly proportional to the harm potential of a substance. Such restrictions included how/where the substance can be obtained (e.g., pharmacy/prescription only, adult only stores, supermarkets, etc.), who is able to obtain it (e.g., 18+), and where the substance can be consumed (e.g., cafe, licensed venue, etc.).

And what gives us any assurance that legalization will lead to a workable policy under 'the state', rather than a corrupt one? Consider the legalization of gambling. Perhaps the same arguments might have been advanced for this as are now advanced in favor of legalizing drugs; but now it is exceptionally difficult to get serious reform of or restraint on gambling. Why? Partly because too many states are addicted to it themselves, through tax revenues; partly because the big gambling syndicates wield every bit as much corrupt power behind the scenes as did any criminal syndicate in the bad old days. Has there been a net gain? It isn't clear to me that there has been. So with drugs, it is easy to see the attractions of a situation in which drug cartels had been removed from the scene and education and rehabilitation programs had greatly reduced the incidence of destructive drug abuse. It's somewhat harder to feel sure that this is what would actually take place. Finally, alcohol and tobacco are legal and, if it could be shown that currently illegal drugs would actually have less harmful effect (once legal) than these drugs, then the case for legalization would be strong.

It covers substances like marijuana, coca, opium and psylocibin which have long histories of human use and which humans seem to be capable of regulating (at least under the right circumstances) via custom; it also includes newer things like the synthetic opiates and amphetamines which we have as a species much less experience with. Policy should be evidence-based, in any case, and take into account the evidence relating to each substance in question.

But in general I think criminalisation hasn't worked. It criminalises both social and problem drug use, though the two are different. While social use can turn into problem use, not all drug use is abuse; just as even though social drinking can turn into alcoholism, not all social drinking is alcoholism. Criminalising social use is repressive and makes criminals out of bored teenagers. Criminalising addiction takes a health problem and adds a legal one: it multiplies problems rather than solving them.

The most repressive totalitarian societies on earth, and the toughest prisons, haven't managed to eliminate illicit drug use via prohibitions and punishments. Either prohibitions and punishments don't work adequately to eliminate drug use, or they have to be even tougher than anything the most repressive societies on earth have tried so far. None of us wants to make Australia more repressive that the most totalitarian societies in history, so we have to try something else.

On the other side, societies which have experimented with decriminalisation or legalisation don't seem to have fallen apart. They also have the advantage of being able to use the many mechanisms we've developed to manage legal drugs - regulation, taxation, testing and controls for purity. I say we give it a try.

I think the question of whether children need parents of both sexes for a healthy upbringing is an important one for us as a community to ponder, but not the government. If the state is going to get into the business of judging the eligibility of a couple (or a single parent for that matter) to raise children, where does it stop? This seems like a dangerous path to tread.
I think a major cause of the conflict and confusion in this whole issue arises from the weird intermingling of religion and law in the institution of marriage. There is a reason we have a policy of separation of church and state - it avoids discriminating against all but one religion and prevents that one religion having undue power over the law - yet this policy seems to be somewhat neglected in the case of marriage. I must confess that I am hardly across the intricacies of marriage law, but, as I understand it, marriage is recognised as a legal contract by the state and yet is performed as a religious rite. I think the two should be completely separate.
Apparently many activists for gay marriage feel dissatisfied by civil unions, even if they now allegedly provide equal legal rights to marriage. I'm not surprised. The law recognises marriage as the primary contract between life partners; couples excluded from this legally recognised rite are understandably unconsoled by a socially inferior substitute. Imagine sending a 10-year-old to a dress-up party in his pajamas when all the other kids are wearing superhero outfits... But FUNCTIONALLY the pajamas still serve the same purpose don't they???
If the state recognized only one civil contract and made it available to any pair of adults who sign the appropriate forms, then we wouldn't have this problem.
I object to the state forcibly modifying the institution of marriage for the same reason that I object to it being involved in the institution of marriage in the first place: it violates the separation of church and state by directly interfering with a religious rite. If a couple wants to ceremoniously bind themselves together in a religious rite, let that be a mutually voluntary spiritual transaction between a couple and the faith of their choice. If they want to gain legal benefits by binding themselves together in the eyes of the law, let them sign a civil union contract.",,"",5,"",,"",,"",,"",5

For a start there is no scientific rationale for banning the chewing of say, coca leaf, a mild drug.  But even the harder drugs, and their associated problems are best dealt with through a prescription based system or regulated licensing system. 

The drug war kills more people than drugs do. It stigmatises users making them less likely to get help from authorities. Rave drugs which are extremely popular and commonplace are cooked up in 'toilets' -- i.e. as a result of the drug war, young people are swallowing completely unregulated dangerous ingredients.  You can't just say ""don't eat that"" to a 21 year old.  I don't know if drug use would go up under legalisation (there is evidence that it wouldn't, or would only replace other legal drug use e.g. binge drinking), but it seems that 14 year olds are more able to get drugs as a result of illicit drug supply networks than they would if there was a regulated system.

What would the criminal drug industry do if drugs were legal?  Most would probably still work in the drug industry - but they would be subject to controls on quality, business practice and all the rest of it. This is what happened when prohibition ended.

For sure they are not going to just go away !  They will cut the prices of drugs being sold legally and push their goods to under age users.   Those who wish to legalise drugs are almost always users themselves who want to ensure they are not pulled into the criminal justice system for what they see as a petty offence or those who have their head in the clouds and believe in less control and more freedom for individuals.  However
as John Stuart Mill said freedom for the individual is only acceptable if it does not infringe the rights of others.   Anyone who has ever lived with a drug user will be able to tell you the devastating effects drug use has on families and societies.
It has been suggested that  only 10% of those use use drugs casually become dependent.  So if the base total is l00 people just 10 will become problematic users
- but if drugs are legalised and the base becomes 10,000 users then the numbers of problem users shoot up to 1,000 -  and so on.

The real answer to this problem is good drug prevention.  Show young people by all means possible that drugs are unhealthy and unecessary.  Teach them the
true facts that drugs can and do ruin lives.  That drugs prevent them from reaching their potential.  That the temporary high they get from drug use can never match the natural high.   That drugs are twenty times stronger than those available forty years ago.  Encourage them to have a life filled with challenges, interests, concern for others, a realisation of what the global drugs trade does to poor and desperate people in producing countries and what they do to the environment. Show them that drugs are just a means for dealers to make huge sums of money without contributing to society in any way at all.
I speak as a professional working in the drugs field for over 20 years - and also as a grandmother who has seen how drug use has destroyed three generations of my own family.
Only  when we can put piles of drugs at every street corner and have young people walk past and say 'no thanks I don't need that stuff' will we have succeeded.

Marriage is a deeply meaningful concept in modern secular Australia; to deny it to a proportion of couples on the basis of the shape of their genitalia alone is unjustly discriminatory, and deeply hurtful. As a married heterosexual, I am sickened that my government continues to withhold this right from a minority of couples, for no good reason.

Jim Wallace fails to present any convincing argument that allowing same-sex marriage (SSM) would have any negative consequences. Let me address his attempts one by one:

1. ""Homosexuality and heterosexuality are different"": When we're talking about marriage as a committed, loving relationship between two consenting adults - no, they're not different in any substantial way. I don't know about Jim Wallace, but my marriage to my wife is about much more than the shape of our genitalia.

2. ""You cannot possibly deny calls for polygamy"": Polygamy is not the topic of discussion here, and could be made illegal or legal independently of the state of same-sex marriage. Please stay on-topic.

3. ""There is no discrimination"": Denying a committed couple the right to a wedding on the basis of the shape of their genitalia alone is unjust discrimination.

4. ""Religious freedom will be threatened"": Firstly, marriage is a secular institution. I did not get married in a Church, and my marriage has nothing to do with any religion. Secondly, who exactly is ""threatening"" religious freedom? The majority of Australian Christians already support same-sex marriage... (http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/a-majority-of-christians-support-marriage-equality/)

Jim Wallace's arguments are incredibly weak, so I see it as inevitable that same-sex marriage will be accepted in the near future. I just hope the numerous dedicated, committed same-sex couples in Australia today don't have to wait too long to be able to finally have their own official wedding ceremonies.

An argument that applies to one drug does not necessarily apply to others. 
But before one starts to exchange arguments in favor or contra the legalization of some or all of the drugs that are illegal now, it would be a good idea to make explicit what the implicit aims and assumptions behind those arguments usually are: for example, how important is personal freedom in comparison to whatever one may see as a greater common good of a society? Where does personal freedom, e.g. the freedom to harm oneself end? Most arguments brought forward against the legalization of drugs are based on the issue of harm: it is claimed that drugs are bad because they cause damage to people or because they have a negative impact on society as a whole and because of that they should be illegal. But many other things do cause harm or have a negative impact on society and are not only not illegal but often popular or actively supported: the legal drug alcohol causes magnitutes more damage, illnes, deaths and social problems than all illegal drugs combined. Driving cars and accidents caused by extreme sports cause damage and huge amounts of cost. The availability of cheap high-sugar and high-fat food probably causes more damage than all bad effects of legal and illegal drugs combined. Why should it make sense to allow one thing and criminalize the other?  Another issue is whether the claim that damage is done is even correct, or correct to the extent claimed. And even if there is damage, does criminalizing the use actually decrease the damage or rather increase it because the whole business gets into the hands of ruthless organized crime? And finally: even if drugs do cause damage why should the state criminalize one way of hurting oneself so rigorously while allowing other ways of causing damage to oneself or even others? Why should criminalizing drugs, especially such popular drugs like cannabis in any way work better the prohibition of alcohol worked which was: not at all?
The arguments in favor and opposing legalization have been brought forward countless times. It would be moot to repeat  them here. Experts largely agree for decades now that legalization would overall be the better solution. 
My feeling is that this is really about blief systems rather than facts. The facts are largely on the side of legalization.

(1) The assertion of Drug Free Australia that the UN convention on drugs is working is false ... as reported in many places such as The Economist.  Prohibition doesn't work, enriches the kingpins (we know this from Al Capone), brings people into criminal circles, and perhaps most importantly, risks lives by poor quality control that means people ingest contaminants.

The rest can be summed up ... politicians aren't pharmacologists ... let the expert agencies with pharmacologists decide, based on generic rules from politicians.

(2) There is an appropriate agency to decide, on a rational basis, how pharmacological agents should be controlled - the Therapeutic Goods Administration - including labelling, with declaration of ingredients, and, if necessary for those compounds that /are/ dangerous, registered suppliers.  The TGA can also be much more responsive to new compounds than lawmakers.

(3) If political parties believe in price controlling usage, then a pigovian tax for non-prescription use is appropriate (with government able to declare, for each drug, the recovery or profit rate to cover costs as determined by epidemiologists - either in the TGA or via the NHMRC) - essentially taxed proportional to toxicity

(4) There should be non bans on doctors prescribing anything - they prescribe much more dangerous drugs, sensitive to the condition (my anti-convulsants are much more dangerous than many recreational drugs).

(5) There are problems with the definitions - for example, cannabis is a significantly different ""formulation"" depending on the ratio of cannabidiol (CBD - neuroprotective) and cannabinol (THC - problematic psychologically in susceiptible individuals).  Both are useful medically, and it is only some strains recently popular, so called ""skunk"", that are high THC/CBD ratios and more likely to lead to psychological harm in some people.  Confusing the two is akin to confusing alcohol with absinthe (wormword).  Politicians are highly unlikely to make laws that differentiate compounds - a single atom can make it markedly different in the body, yet be indistinguishable in standard analytical tests.

(6) If driving is an issue, then licit or illicit is irrelevant - a simple handheld ""gameboy"" version of a walk-the-white-line test can examine reaction time and hand/eye co-ordination directly - giving a quantitative result about driving capability, and not caring if the person is too infirm to drive, too sleepy, whether they are on antihistamines making them drowsy, a known recreational drug, or an unknown one.",,"",,"",,"",6,"",,"",6

If necessary, the rent assistance could be guaranteed to be paid on rent by direct payment to the owners or agents.

Heroin dependance is very much like a disease and 'recreational' heroin users are rare.  So a doctor can prescribe heroin only after alternatives such as buprenorphine and methadone have been attempted and failed.  A person could not simply go to a doctor and demand some heroin for the weekend.

For cannabis, it is probably more of a recreational drug (except for a limited number of medical cannabis users) and therefore the medical issues are similar to, say, tobacco and alcohol.  No prescription would be needed.  In both cases, criminals would have less customers as it would be easier to obtain the drug legally than illegally (unless you're a recreational heroin user in which case you'd still need to rely on criminals.)

But what about cocaine, MDMA (ecstasy,) and methamphetamine?  These are more potent drugs than cannabis but their use is difficult to 'medicalise.'  For someone who does some cocaine or ecstasy every second weekend how could these be practically supplied?  If they required a prescription, a doctor is required to diagnose a disease and determine the best treatment by comparing the risks and benefits.  But what disease is a recreational MDMA user suffering?  Would the doctor ask what kind of party they're going to, how they're getting home, how their mental health is etc. and then prescribe the drug for the patient's enjoyment?  Where does that put the doctor and how does that align with our current understanding of medical ethics and the role of a doctor?  The same would be the case with a pharmacist doing something similar.

If MDMA, meth and coke were readily available in special stores, we would end up with a situation where not only would there be no medical supervision, but a person could obtain methamphetamine more easily than valium, a less dangerous drug, resulting in an absurd inconsistency.  So, it would seem, the 'legalisation' solution only really works for cannabis and heroin (and maybe MDMA if it someone came up with a stricter regime than cannabis sale but less strict than heroin supply) but it's hard for me to imagine a practical way of supplying cocaine and methamphetamine in a way that wouldn't compromise the ethics and role of a doctor or pharmacist but would still not be sold as readily as cannabis.",,"",,"",,"",7,"",,"",7

Importantly, this must always be a personal compromise that is informed by, among other things, their personal ethics (whether they be religiously based or otherwise). This must also true of organisations that seek to represent the political interests of groups of voters (such as unions, business councils, environmental organisations, GetUP!, etc).

Corporations on the other hand, are profit-making entities with the statutory obligation to maximise profits for their shareholders. Importantly, this is irrespective of the individual shareholders’ other wider interests. And, although corporations are run by people, the decisions they make must ultimately be guided by the corporation’s profit imperative. As such, any corporate political activism (including donations to political parties) is a corruption of democracy because it is not multi-faceted and negotiated in the same way that it is for people and the organisations that represent them.

For example, we could convert the first $50 of tax paid by every citizen into a ""democracy voucher"" that can be donated to any political candidate that agrees to accept donations only from Australian citizens, capped at $150 per citizen. This is a scheme that was proposed by Lawrence Lessig for reforming US campaign finance. He chose the $50 figure for the US so that the potential revenue from democracy vouchers would be substantially more than current political campaign revenue from all sources. Thus political candidates would have an incentive to voluntarily reject large contributions in favour of many small contributions. Citizens could potentially delegate their democracy voucher to political organizations whose principles they agree with and who have the time and expertise to navigate the political landscape on their behalf.

I would argue that this strategy would be better than either doing nothing or banning political donations by organisations outright. Surely there are yet better strategies and we should look for those too.

Biggest disadvantages of banning political donations by organisations:
--> It would undermine the ability of political organisations to facilitate collective action by channeling the donations of many citizens to fight for a cause they collectively believe in.
--> If this source of campaign funding were replaced directly with public funding then whatever agency were given responsibility for allocating that funding would have too much discretionary power and would probably tend to favour established political entities at the expense of small parties and independents. 

Biggest disadvantages of the status quo:
-> Wealthy individuals and corporations have undue influence in our political process.
----> Political campaigns are financed disproportionately by the wealthiest individuals and corporations.
----> Political contributions can buy influence in parliament. This is necessarily true however indirect the influence might be because, at a fundamental level, politicians are faced with an incentive to shape their actions to attract contributions.
----> Therefore wealthy individuals and corporations have influence in parliament disproportionate to the number of citizens whose interests they represent. This will tend to distort our laws away from representing the public interest.
----> The argument that corporations have a right to influence in politics because they benefit our society is flawed. A democracy is premised on granting equal rights to all citizens. To the extent that corporations benefit the citizens of society, those citizens have an incentive to advocate laws that support the socially beneficial activities of corporations, but no corporation's interests are directly aligned with those of the public so the more influence corporations have in politics the more our laws will favour corporate interests at the expense of the public interest.
-> The perception that money is corrupting politics undermines public confidence in our political system.
----> Lack of confidence in the system tends to reduce participation which would tend to further draw political power away from the people, leading to a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.",,"",7,"",,"",,"",,"",7

The trail of corporate donations and the blatant political decisions by the receiving political party once in government has been very well established in the US where this practice is most prevalent, but also in some European countries. Whereas some may argue that this is not so prevalent in Australia (and there is some truth to that), it is common practice here too and the danger of corporations taking over policy is one that must be avoided. In my view, citizens, as voters, should be able to donate money to political parties (with a cap to be negotiated) and these donations should be publicly disclosed above a $500 amount. Corporations are not people and therefore should not be able to make political donations. Same for NGOs and other similar groups.

Political donations distort elections and policy, but they also distort the politician's conduct. How many politicians end up then with executive salaries, or sitting on corporate boards?

Drugs are readily available everywhere, they're not controlled which means and are therefore a danger to the consumer. The black market of drugs creates a whole underworld of trafficking and crime and consumers, who are themselves victims, are criminalised. 

Legalisation does not mean that drugs would be readily available in the supermarket and would flood the market and the streets as some prophets of doom like to say. Legalisation would allow the drugs to be controlled both in production and distribution. In terms of production, the drug would be of the same purity which would drastically reduce the danger of overdose and harm. In terms of distribution, crime would be reduced. Drugs would be taxed. Consumers would benefit from the quality control of production, from increased health services and decriminalisation.

I'm not saying it's a simple issue but I do believe a change of strategy is needed after years of criminalisation (mostly of people who are victims themselves) and decriminalisation coupled with a controlled legalisation process has benefits that outweigh the cons. ",,"",,"",,"",6,"",,"",6

My first criterion would be to ensure diversity in ownership of media. Reinhart is not a media baron, so the proposed deal would not reduce diversity. In fact diversity is increasing rapidly thanks to the Internet, as reflected by Fairfax’s plummeting profitability. I suspect its influence has also declined over time and if the editorial slant were to change to mimic The Australian (as suggested above), it would decline further and a gap would open in the market for more left-leaning news coverage.

What other reasonable, objective criteria could be used to block this proposed deal? Large business interests outside media? This would require a major shakeup of existing ownership.

I imagine than Gina Rinehart, as the richest woman in the world, is not looking for financial gain nor considering a bail out of Fairfax to aid shareholders, staff or customers.  I believe her goal will be social influence and anyone who has editorial control is well poised to achieve this.  This power and control probably will prevent good journalism from prevailing and result in a skewed account of facts in the hope to influence society.  Unfortunately this probably already exists with government owned media outlets etc. but that is know reason to promote another source.

Also, we want it to be a voice for the people.  As businesses the media is supposed to make a profit - the best profit possible.  If the way to make a huge amount of dough is to do a poor job of reporting the news; to supply it through a biased lens; and to feed world-view confirming stories back to a non-critical public rather than reporting balanced and objective stories, then we have a disconnect between democratic needs and business reality.  

The solution?  I am not entirely sure - having a strong and independent government media company like the ABC is good, but this can still can easily stray into its own bias, and is also often discarded as government spin by segments of the population.  And in fact with a sufficiently dubious government it may also literally become just a propaganda voice.  Also, some demographics simply do not follow the ABC or SBS, so they stop hearing part of the argument - dangerous.

The private media as it currently stands counteract this, but if the same political/interest groups control both government and private voices (I think this is entirely possible if we end up with a strongly right wing government, whilst our private media is also strongly right wing), where do we end up?    Further, even were it to remain independent, the ABC would need to be significantly expanded to reach the same breadth of audience that the private Australian media do, and this is possibly not practical.

As it stands we rely on our private media to be at least reasonably independent and objective - if Fairfax becomes Ginafax, then it will likely become nothing but another very large soapbox for some very rich and opinionated people.  Australian thought and democracy will suffer for it - to have a debate, you need more than one side, and we will probably no longer have that.

Until a better option comes along we must have independent and objective voices in the private media.  We must hear all sides of the story.  We must have balance - or as close as we can get to it.  Therefore Fairfax cannot be allowed to become a soapbox for Gina Rinehart and her compatriots.

So maybe the traditional power structures of newspapers and TV are being eroded by the internet and social media.Like ,""How many people read the paper or watch TV for the news?"" 
It's also a sad reflection of our own values. Our greed, materialism and selfishness are being substituted for the traditional Australian values of a""fair go"" and egalitarianism.

In Australia, the concentration of ownership is already of grave concern as its homogeneity of reporting offers the citizens reduced, limited information within narrow boundaries.

We are now at a stage where the majority of Australians believe that we should have marriage equality. A smaller, yet significant group of Australians feels this threatens the sanctity of traditional marriage and could have negative impacts on children. Let's explore a few of those ideas.

First off - the idea of traditional marriage. Marriage has never been a static institution - it is a cultural ceremony that has evolved throughout the ages to meet the needs and values of various communities. Even looking purely at Judeo-Christian history of marriage we can see that marriage and associated norms have undergone a serious transformation over the last 2000 years. Personally, I like to believe that in a lot of ways it has evolved for the better. 

Legal access to contraception and divorce is a relatively new thing. Wives were -- until fairly recently -- the legal property of their husbands and back in the day, if a newly wed bride could not prove her virginity she could be stoned to death (Genesis 2:24). Polygamy is well represented in the Old Testament (Jacob and his sons had several wives and concubines) and under the authority of Moses, the Israelites were ordered to kill all the Midianite men, women and children except for the virgin girls were could be taken as spoils of war and forced to marry their captors/rapists. Interfaith and interracial marriages were also traditionally illegal or forbidden. Rape within marriage was only made illegal in all Australia states in 1992. So hopefully we can see that the idea of 'traditional marriage' is largely a misnomer. I don't think there are many people in Australia that would want to go back to traditional marriage Old Testament style, or even to marriage pre-1992. 

Another popular argument against marriage equality is that marriage is intended for the creation of children. Yet in modern society many couples decide not to have children or choose to adopt either for humanitarian or fertility reasons. We would not dream of telling infertile couples, or couples that choose not to have children that they can not marry. Baring your own children may traditionally have been an integral part of marriage, but that is no longer the case for many couples in modern Australia. 

Another argument is that children need a mother and a father in order to thrive. Once again, this seems somewhat outdated. Many children (myself included) have been raised by single parents, grandparents or extended family. No one in modern Australia is going to tell a single mother or father that they are not fit to raise their child, so why should we single out gay couples? Several well documented studies have actually shown that lesbian parents out-perform heterosexual parents. Having a stable, loving home environment seems to be the most important foundation for raising a child. And given that, shouldn't we be supporting more couples to enter loving committed relationships in which raise children rather than ostracising them?

Another worry for religious groups is that they will be forced to perform gay marriage ceremonies against their will. If I was a Christian in a gay relationship and I was planning my big day and wanted to get married in a religious ceremony -- would I choose to a) force someone who thought that our relationship was an abomination against God to preside over the celebration and scowl at us as we pledged our undying love (supposedly a happy, uplifting event) just to prove a point. Or would I b) seek out a queer friendly church who supported our relationship and would help us make our big day a truly magical, loving and wonderful celebration. Pretty sure I would go with option b). I'm sure that there are people out there who would want to go with option a) - but I think they would be a very small minority and I'm sure something could be included in a marriage amendment act which could protect the rights of religious groups to choose not to marry gay couples.

Lastly, we have the 'slippery slope' argument that allowing gay marriage would be part of a decline  that would soon see us allowing polygamous or incestuous marriages. Can't say I have seen a big push in Australia for either polygamy or incest. If there is ever a large section of the community that wants those changes made, (which I can't see happening in any of our lifetimes) that would be a discussion for then, not now. 

Rather than seeing marriage a fixed and unchangeable, why can't we see it for what it is -- a tradition that has changed and evolved to meet the needs and cultural values of different communities. Now, in Australia in the year 2012, the majority of Australians believe that we can have a fairer, more loving society by including gay couples in our definition of marriage. To me, this is something wonderful that should be embraced. I like to think that our global community is slowly evolving away from fear, violence and tribal segregation, towards greater love, empathy and community and I believe that legalising marriage equality is another important step in that journey. It's time for marriage equality in Australia. The majority have spoken.

By separating the two, you totally take the sting out of the whole marriage debate. It also makes it highly unlikely that a gay couples would seek to be married by a religious group who didn't want to marry them, and impossible to force that group to perform the ceremony.

By reducing the value of a vote (by corporations purchasing influence), the ability for citizens to secure their rights is diminished, particularly when their rights are in conflict with the 'rights' that a corporation wishes to secure.

There are just ten countries (as far as I can tell) that allow full state recognised same sex marriage. And, in all of them, more than one in three of all marriages (same sex or otherwise) in in divorce. 

Now some of these stats are a bit wobbly. For example, Spain has only recently allowed divorce, so the rate of divorce hasn't really settled down. (Currently, a marriage breaks down every 3.19 minutes - but that can't go on forever.) Anyway, for what it's worth, here's the rate of divorce in those countries which have changed the definition of marriage:

The carbon tax will help achieve 3 of those and lay the ground-work for the fourth.

Australia is the 7th largest CO2 emitter in the world (although we come 17th when other GHG are factored in). 40% of the world's CO2 emissions are from countries who emit less than us. By that measure we do make a significant contribution and thus have a responsibility to reduce our own emissions. The carbon tax will help achieve real emissions reductions. Of course a 5% reduction (the stated aim) is not enough, when applied globally, to avoid dangerous climate change but it provides the mechanism for further reductions.

Action by any country alone will make little difference in climate change. Global action, whether through a binding international treaty or individual actions by states combined with a range of bilateral and multilateral agreements, is going to be required. A broad emissions reduction mechanism, aka the carbon tax, sets an example, gives Australia leverage in international negotiations and provides a basis for entering into a global carbon market. There's no worse position to be in, in international negotiations, then that of a hypocrite. With an increasing number of countries developing emissions trading schemes (including those with a fixed price like Australia), we can't afford not to be among them. Of course, international action depends on the skills of our diplomats and the willingness of other countries but a carbon tax is a great start.

By making CO2 intensive industries more expensive a carbon tax encourages investment in technologies that are cleaner or more energy efficient. This investment (coupled with targeted government funding of research and development of these activities) should speed the development of these industries in Australia. As other countries seek to reduce their emissions there will be an increase in global demand for these technologies. A carbon tax will help ensure that the Australian economy is well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.

Finally Australia will have to grapple with the CO2 emissions we export in the form of coal, oil and gas. These dwarf our domestic emissions and could potentially play a major role in dangerous climate change if they were all extracted and burnt. The absence of a global agreement could justify unilateral action on our part, but only if we have seriously addressed our domestic emissions (which is where the carbon tax comes in). This is a new area of debate, that I expect to intensify over the coming years.

Of course the carbon tax isn't perfect. There have been many legitimate criticisms, in that it won't be as effective as it needs to be and that the revenue raised (which in my opinion is an entirely separate question than the tax itself) isn't being used to further the goals of the carbon tax.

1. Whilst I believe we need to be more responsible with the global resources we have, I cannot understand why governments are running with the difficult to prove 'Global Warming / Climate Change' argument when they could more easily convince consumers about limited resources.  For this reason, anything that relies on this argument to make money is questionable.
2. If the burning of fossil fules is indeed resulting in higher global temperatures and extreme weather conditions (Which personally I am a skeptic of) then I cannot see how a tax is going to be effective in curbing this phenemonom. What I believe will happen is companies that are taxed will pass on the expense to the general public, then perhaps change their processes to reduce their tax but not pass on the saving, resulting in even more inflation and stress on the household budget.
3. Why do we not tax our export of fossil fuels? It is all well and good trying to reduce Australia's contribution to CO2 emiisions which I believe run at around 0.003% on a global scale but we allow China to purchase coal with no carbon tax and they will use and contribute a much higher percentage, around 10% at a guesstimate.  This I feel is hypocritical to the attempt of reducing emissions globally.  

I would much rather advocate a tax to reduce consumerism by taxing what we throw away.  This would eventually put pressure back on manufacturers to produce items that last and will increase our service industry rather than filling our rubbish dumps with toxic, non-biodgradable items.  Unfortunately reducing consumerism goes against capitalism which is probably the underlying agenda of the carbon tax in the first place.

But let's put that aside and look at the problems with the arguments in favour of repeal.

1. The tax hurts businesses and households less than opponents would have us believe. The inflationary impact is expected to be moderate – less so than the introduction of the GST, and we survived that. Significant compensation further reduces the impact. Also, any plan to repeal the carbon tax should take into account how much the proposed alternative hurts businesses and households, either in the short term (costs of an alternative plan) or in the long term (costs of inaction).

2. The tax is not pointless; it's an important starting point. If all it does is prepare our economy for even stronger action in the future, that's valuable in itself. Perhaps Australia's action will only make a small difference initially, but that's no reason that we should instead favour inaction or schemes shown to be even less effective.

3. If the tax truly is badly designed, the solution is not to throw out the tax – the solution is to fix the design. Perhaps we should be taxing consumption rather than production, but if we allow that to be used as an argument for repealing the tax, we run the risk of having either no carbon reduction measures in place at all, or measures that are less effective and/or more costly. Furthermore, if we are destined to have a different scheme in future that taxes consumption or addresses design flaws, the easiest way to get there is by changing the carbon tax, not by repealing it and starting from scratch.

4. Let's say the timing is bad. (I disagree; I think it's overdue.) Chances are, if we wait till later, the timing will be worse. Both in terms of our ability to tackle climate change, and our ability to succeed in global markets that are shifting towards economies based on renewable energy.

5. Illegitimate? Implementing an important policy when you realise it's infeasible to stick to a past election promise is not necessarily undemocratic.

It was suggested it may be better as a view, where more can see it.  So here it is.  Hope that's ok with you all).  

Western Democracies want our media to act as a watchdog and clearing house for ideas. Also, we want it to be a voice for the people. As businesses the media is supposed to make a profit - the best profit possible. If the way to make a huge amount of dough is to do a poor job of reporting the news; to supply it through a biased lens; and to feed world-view confirming stories back to a non-critical public rather than reporting balanced and objective stories, then we have a disconnect between democratic needs and business reality.

The solution? I am not entirely sure - having a strong and independent government media company like the ABC is good, but this can still can easily stray into its own bias, and is also often discarded as government spin by segments of the population. And in fact with a sufficiently dubious government it may also literally become just a propaganda voice. Also, some demographics simply do not follow the ABC or SBS, so they stop hearing part of the argument - dangerous.

The private media as it currently stands counteract this, but if the same political/interest groups control both government and private voices (I think this is entirely possible if we end up with a strongly right wing government, whilst our private media is also strongly right wing), where do we end up? Further, even were it to remain independent, the ABC would need to be significantly expanded to reach the same breadth of audience that the private Australian media do, and this is possibly not practical.

As it stands we rely on our private media to be at least reasonably independent and objective - if Fairfax becomes Ginafax, then it will likely become nothing but another very large soapbox for some very rich and opinionated people. Australian thought and democracy will suffer for it - to have a debate, you need more than one side, and we will probably no longer have that.

Until a better option comes along we must have independent and objective voices in the private media. We must hear all sides of the story. We must have balance - or as close as we can get to it.

1) The arguments presented aren't really nuanced enough to inform (other than to catalogue common opinions). This sort of oversimplification is a common problem with any discussion related to climate change: to be able to really understand and comment in a meaningful way, you need to take the time to really understand the detail.

2) There is a common and obvious argument missing on the ""For"" side, which is: ""It should be repealed because climate change is not a threat, and therefore the carbon tax is unneccessary"".

3) For those who, like myself, believe that climate change does pose serious risks that need to be addressed, the issue isn't really framed with sufficient precision. The decision about whether it should be repealed depends on what the intended replacement is: the Coalition's plan or something entirely new.

If we are talking about going back to the drawing board and replacing it with something that no political party is currently proposing, then that is an interesting discussion, but it probably doesn't have much to do with what is likely to happen our short term future. So for the rest of my post, I will assume that the issue is whether we should repeal the carbon tax and replace it with the Coalition's plan. My current opinion is no, because, in spite of the problems with the current carbon tax, I think the Coalition's plan is worse. (Perhaps we could have a related YourView discussion where we look at the Coalition's plan in detail.)

For those who are interested, here are my comments on the ""arguments"" that have been presented:

FOR:

1) The tax hurts businesses and households.

The design of the scheme is ""intended"" to hurt businesses and (relatively) wealthy households that are unable or unwilling to change their energy consumption behaviour. Having said this, there is a lot of compensation being provided to help industry to transition to cleaner and/or more efficient energy usage. Compensation is also being provided to the majority of households (which may be better off in some cases). I personally suspect that the impact will be negligible, but let's monitor it and see.

2) The tax is pointless.

If you accept that action on climate change is needed, then this simply isn't true. Will it solve the global climate change problem on its own? No. However, it will give Australia some credibility in climate change negotiations, and it will result in cleaner energies being more cost competitive (meaning we should be able to transition to non-greenhouse-gas sources of energy faster).

3) The tax is badly designed.

I would agree that it has been seriously compromised. I believe it is less bad than the current Coalition alternative, and that it can be incrementally improved to something that might someday be reasonable.

(The idea of taxing consumption rather than production is an interesting one, but completely academic unless one of the political parties is prepared to put it on the table).

4) The timing is bad.

If you think the risks of climate change need to be addressed, then it is pretty hard to argue for further delay. Is there likely to be a better time in the near, medium, or long term?

5) The tax is illegitimate.

I can understand this point of view, particularly if your decision to vote Labor in 2010 was based on the understanding that there would be no carbon tax. I would be pissed too. It sucks, but it is not unprecedented behaviour (by either Labor or the Coalition). I happen to think that the carbon tax is the best policy option on the table at the moment, but if there was an opportunity to vote for a major party that would consistently behave more ethically, then I probably would, even if they had an inferior policy (unfortunately I don't think this option is open to us at the moment).

AGAINST:

1) The tax is the best way to reduce global warming.

This is probably overstated. You can say that most experts seem to think that a price on carbon (either a tax or an emissions trading scheme) is the most cost-effective way to go. In the sense that the Australia carbon tax is a price on carbon, it fits in with what is currently considered best practice.

Note that experts also acknowledge that it might make sense to supplement this with other forms of action (regulations, subsidies, R&D, etc.) depending of the individual circumstances of each country. Although the carbon price is the main feature of the Government's ""Clean Energy Future"" package, they are also using some of these other forms of action as well. The Coalition plan relies on other forms of action (mainly subsidy) without a carbon price.

2) The tax helps usher in in a new economy.

Probably true.

3) Repeal would create business uncertainty.

Agreed. The threat of repeal also creates uncertainyy.

4) The tax would be too hard to unwind.
5) Repeal would be a budget nightmare.

It is difficult to get agreement on anything relating to climate change.  Discussion gets lost in the complexity of the subject - and we do need to get off fossil fuels, given possible peak induced shortages.  Quite aside from that, more sources of energy mean more options which may well mean cheaper prices!
2.  Possible - but more an argument that we will need to tweak the tax, rather than revoke it.
3.  Yes - we are but a drop in the ocean relative to China, India, etc.  On the other hand, the world needs to take whatever 'baby steps towards daylight' that it can to solve this problem - and Australia will at least gain credibility when it argues that other countries should take steps to solve climate change, which is something we have lacked so far.
4.  Taxing consumerism - interesting idea.  Perhaps something that could be a synergy with the carbon tax, rather than a replacement.  I do feel that it may be too indirect to be as powerful as a carbon tax/market though - businesses need stay profitable to survive and be successful and the carbon tax hits them directly.  Consumers on the other hand, will accept a certain level of increased cost because of convenience, advertising, and market forces robbing them of choice.

1. Yes, there are other benefits of carbon pricing, and the long-term payback of addressing ""climate change"" is probably the most difficult to explain to the majority who want to get a quick fix and move on. Why the government chose the harder path I do not know, but it has no bearing on whether the idea of a price is good or bad.
2. Let's say that companies passed on the full cost to consumers. If one of their competitors chose instead to curb their carbon emissions, and pass this ""saving"" to consumers by reducing prices, then they will gain customers. It's how the market works.
3. I totally agree with this! Again it is not an ""either/or"" choice. But since Australia sell 25% of the world's coal, that is how we can have the most influence. There is also the concept of a ""frontier tax"", the argument being that it is far simpler and effective to tax at the point where fossil fuels *enter* the economy (e.g. imports and mining) rather than at it's *exit* (e.g. emissions and waste). But we can do this IN ADDITION to a carbon price. So I do not see it as a reason to repeal the legislation.

The other argument that is so often neglected is that it is the government's responsibility to correct an externalisation. Historically, businesses have been able to dump waste into the atmosphere FOR FREE; they cause the problem, but pay nothing to correct the damage (i.e. the cost is externalised, in this case the cost is left for future generations to foot the bill). So really we have been paying the wrong price all along.",,"",,"",,"",,"",7,"",7

In addition to the many good comments made against repeal of the tax, I would like to expand on the aspect that relates to international bargaining. It has been said by many against the repeal that having a C-tax on the table would give us credentials in the discussions regarding combating AGW, which would be a great thing as Australia is one of the highest per capita CO2 emitters in the world, not to mention that we enable others such as China to create enormous carbon debt. Not only would a C-tax improve our credibility but, as a small western country and one mostly insulated from the GFC, we would serve as a great proof-of-principle for other countries to use in their deliberations about such approaches to CO2 reduction.

Another point I'd like to address: taxing consumption vs production. Taxing a product is different (ie, consumption) to fining those who emit pollutants (ie, CO2 production), which is what a C-tax does. Placing the onus on the polluter to clean up their act or pass the cost onto those who buy their products gives other producers, who avoid the C-tax by being more energy efficient, an edge in price that will be quickly realized in consumer behaviour. Simply applying an additional tax to any given product would require tracking the source and by administratively impossible to manage; far easier is to penalize consumption of carbon fuel, which is relatively easy to determine.",,"",,"",,"",,"",6,"",6

In particular it fails to address the risk that polluting activities are pushed offshore at the expense of Australian jobs and no benefit to the environment. But in my view the best approach is to improve the current tax incrementally. Repeal would result in confusion, uncertainty, and an equally imperfect replacement which would probably be abandoned in favour of another carbon tax at some point in the future. 

Uncertainty is crippling for business, much more so than a price on carbon. Most businesses can handle a carbon price by passing it on or by making small changes to their practices. But imagine planning a new power station or factory and not knowing whether there will be a price on carbon or some other government policy. 

The reason that repeal would increase uncertainty is that I expect we will eventually have a carbon tax anyway. There is widespread agreement among economists that a price on carbon is the most efficient way of reducing emissions because a carbon price enables markets to decide how best to allocate resources rather than letting governments make those decisions.

Finally, to those who point out that Australia produces only a small amount of global emissions, my question is this: Does our small size mean that we are entitled to keep increasing our emissions while other countries have to cut theirs? That doesn’t seem right to me. A global effort only works if every country does its bit.

Tax Hurts Businesses and Households?
Wrong. There'll likely be a 0.7% inflationary impact. Less than 1/100th. Compared to other policies (eg, Iraq war) the cost is tiny. Even compared to, say, upgrades to our electricity networks - $45b over 5yrs which has been signed sealed and delivered. Didn't hear anyone complaining about that one and it will likely DOUBLE electricity prices in 5 years. 

Tax is Pointless?
Yes we emit 2-3% of global total. We also only had 0.0001% of troops in WW1 and WW2. Was Gallipoli pointless? This argument is repulsive. (Why don't we all just throw our litter into the street as we only contribute 0.0001%?!)

The tax is badly designed.
The tax isn’t perfect but certainly it’s the best we have. Pricing carbon is the best way to reduce emissions, and this is backed up by any economist worth a cent. Yep, the price will likely fall when the trading scheme starts but this is why there’s a floor – to prevent a crash.

The timing is bad. 
Um… Let’s look to the science for that one. I think we’ll find it’s well overdue. Bugger the GFC, it’s a relatively tiny hit financially to finally start doing something about emissions. Plus we can now start investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency with some certainty. 

The tax is illegitimate.  
Bollock bollock bollocks. Clearly it wasn’t what Gillard had intended before the election but the hung parliament changed the rules. How many times does this need to be explained to people? Let’s look at all the alternatives. Firstly, the one we have, was Gillard bending to Greens and allowing a short-term 3-year carbon fixed price (tax) before the emission trading scheme (which she had promised). The other alternative was Abbott literally saying he’d even “bend over” to Windsor and Oakshott to get power (“The only thing I wouldn't do is sell my arse,  but I'd have to give serious thought to it” http://www.theage.com.au/national/abbott-failed-to-sway-with-a-bum-rap-20110827-1jfs5.html). The third was we go to another election. And probably another hung parliament.

It is now too late to annul the legislation, but not too late to seriously create renewable generation of electricity. Keep in mind that electricity when used is non-polluting and is the cleanest form of energy available for mass distribution. The problem lies in the generating techniques - coal and gas and diesel oil all produce carbon emissions when burned. Water, waves, wind and solar do not. North of the Tropic of Capricorn is the wet end of Australia; the land slopes to the south; the south (Murray Darling Basin in particular) is short of water; running water can be easily turned into fast-moving jets (like your garden hose); hydro electricity is created by fast moving water turning turbines which turn generators. In time, sufficient hydro electricity would cause coal generated electricity to become too expensive to compete and thus uneconomic. Coal fired generation would cease and electricity would be classed as a 'clean fuel'.  Forward thinking is a necessity if the so-called carbon problem is to be overcome. 
And just to add an impossibilty, the carbon tax should have been started at $2.00 per tonne: no compensation: I doubt any current politician would adapt the current legislation to bring the levy down to such a reasonable level.

Thus changing consumer behaviour beyond shifting their purchases to cleaner producers is less of a priority.

To elaborate - the tax is intended to create market incentive for producers to become cleaner, to allow them to compete better against dirty producers, by making it much more expensive to be dirty.  To make the maximum profit (or even stay in business), producers must adapt to be cleaner.  These cleaner producers will be able to offer cheaper and/or better products (because they will have more cash to innovate, provide quality, whatever) and thus consumers should support them in preference to dirty producers.  Et voila – we have a cleaner, greener economy.

In the meantime the market will hit people with higher costs of living.  The economic compensation is there to offset this passing on of costs to those less able to afford it - to equalize the load on society, in effect.  Those who are over a certain level of income/wealth are deemed to be able to shoulder the burden without compensation – and incidentally they are also encouraged to change their lifestyle to bring down costs, which is a bonus.  But this is only a bonus – not the core objective.

That’s the theory as I understand it.  It kind of sucks if you happen to be in the no compensation bracket, and to already have made the changes that may have saved you cash (as you have), but that‘s life.
  
Personally I console myself about the extra cost (I also get no compensation) because I know that fixing climate change is necessary, and this tax is the best step towards fixing climate change that I have yet seen the government implement - or expect to be implemented, at least in the short to medium term.  Therefore I am willing to pay slightly increased costs to support it (actually I would pay significantly higher costs – because I think climate change is that big a risk to the future of human civilization and Australia).

I guess it all comes down to sacrifice.  As a responsible citizen, we sometimes must make personal sacrifices (hopefully small ones) for the good of society.  If we all refuse to make sacrifices because of some unfairness, then nothing changes until it is forced upon us by events beyond our control.  

As well as supporting this tax, we should all try and improve our own lifestyle, as you have already done.  The more steps we can take to stop or even reverse climate change, the better.   I think you can be proud to have done what you personally can already.  You set a good example.

If you accept that climate change is real, then we cannot afford to wait until we are forced.

Yes, initially it probably will. Especially 'trade exposed' industries. However, the damage from things like electricity price increases is marginal compared to the increases we have all endured over the last few years which have had nothing to do with the tax. Except for those businesses which pay the tax directly, the carbon tax is actually one of the smallest cost increases they have had to deal with lately.

Tax is pointless

The argument that because my contribution is small I therefore should do nothing is always a bad argument. The same argument can be applied to voting, 'I only have one vote so it doesn't really matter who I vote for', to shoplifting 'If I shoplift a candy bar from a large store no-one will even notice such a minuscule financial loss'. The point is that when collective action is needed to achieve something, that means individuals have to act. Just because you are not sure whether everyone else will do the right thing doesn't absolve you of your obligation to make your contribution.

Badly designed

This is not really a good argument for repeal but for amending the legislation to fix whatever specific problems there are. The idea of taxing consumption, not production, (i.e. extending the tax to imports and exempting exports) souns like an excellent amendment which should not be difficult to make.

The timing is bad

1. There is not likely to be a better time anytime soon. 

2. If we delay implementation, economists seem to agree that this will make implementation more expensive when we do come to implement a price on carbon emissions. 3.

I won't get into arguments about the so-called ""lie"" but in a way this argument is probably true.

Tumbling with it would be the income of the traficantes and accordingly, their ability to corrupt, and, in countries like Mexico, terrify civil society to the point of paralysis.The traficantes verdict on legalisation would be a virtually unanimous negative.

There are other interest groups who would be equally negative about legalisation. It is not widely recognised that in the US, the ""war"" is a major industry stretching from massively-funded enforcement agencies at the front end to an enormous (and largely privatised) prison system at the back: a prison system in which an enormous proportion of inmates are banged up on drug charges. Also those of us who watched recent TV documentaries on Mexico can be in no doubt that substantial fractions of the ruling elite in Mexico benefit enormously from the drug trade. The same would apply to virtually every other country in Latin America, and one can extrapolate from this. It is difficult to believe that the drug trade can continue in ANY country in the world without a degree of corruption, with all that this implies for the corrosion of civil society

Then we have a more nebulous but still suspect vested interest for the maintenance of prohibition. By a high order of magnitude, tobacco and alcohol kill and maim more people in this country every year than all the other mind-altering drugs put together. It is very much in the interests of the producers of these drugs to maintain in the perceptions of the citizenry the syllogism {(alcohol/tobacco legal, therefore OK):(heroine et al illegal, therefore evil in the extreme)}.

(Here's another interesting little thought bubble about vested interest in prohibition. In a substantial fraction of the  United States a criminal record disenfranchises the person who has it. Drug-related incarceration disproportionately affects Blacks and Latinos who disproportionately vote Democrat, if at all. I wonder what Mitt Romney's thoughts about legalisation might be?).

Many proponents of continued prohibition might agree with all the above but still argue that this is the price we have to pay in order to prevent a flood of drugs engulfing us, and, more importantly our children. The underlying Hogarthian image is one of a sort of modern-day Gin Lane, so let's make a couple of points about the likelihood of this outcome.

First, we already have legalised drugs. We have unacceptably high levels of alcohol abuse and smoking but the nation as a whole is by no means stumbling around in an alcoholic stupor and determined public health policies have been consistently driving down smoking rates for the last twenty years. I would draw the following conclusions from this.

First, that the vast majority of people do not abuse drugs, no matter what their availability. Second, that there is a relatively small minority who do abuse drugs, and they will probably do so whatever their availability. Third, that this minority can be better helped when their addiction is viewed as a public health issue (as in the case of tobacco abuse) rather than a law enforcement issue.

Again, an advocate of prohibition might accept all of these points, but still argue that the illicit drugs are so desperately addictive and so  damaging physically that their widespread availability would lead us straight down Gin Lane. You might describe this as the ""one toke and you're hooked"" argument.

This is not an argument generally supported by the facts. There can be few substances as addictive as nicotine, and any serious analysis would show that heroine and cocaine are no more addictive and do no more tissue damage than the legal drugs. People do not die from heroine ingestion as such, but from the unpredictable quality of an uncontrolled product and the lifestyle they are generally forced to adopt in order to purchase it due to its prohibition-inflated price. Plenty of people die each year from tobacco-related disease. 

Also, anyone with a cursory acquaintance with minorities in certain high-paying professions will be familiar with the weekend user whose high salary permits weekend use without the destructive lifestyle effects imposed on lower-income users and who functions perfectly well in earning that high salary through the week.These people belie the image of the permanently-hooked hollow-eyed user, of whom there are plenty, of course, but because of the price of the product, and not its intrinsic chemical composition.

I make one exception to this, namely methamphetamines, for which there is ample evidence both of acute addictiveness and high levels of physical and psychological damage resulting from use. I would pursue production and distribution of this class of drug with every weapon the law has available. The health case for prohibition is almost as good as that for tobacco.

So why would continuing to prohibit meth not have exactly the same effects as what I have described above in the context of other drugs? As I did at the start, I turn to basic economics, which tells us that the demand for a given product is not only a function of the price and availability of the product itself but also the price and availability of all competing products. This is known as cross-elasticity of demand, and its significance is that the demand for an (admittedly filthy) drug like meth is very directly affected by the price of competitors. One must ask oneself who would be chasing a hit of a high-priced, unpredictably constituted drug like meth when they have easy access to reliable, legal and affordable substitutes. (One could equally well ask who in their right minds would take the risks of manufacturing the stuff unless the price was sky high).

I finish with a disclaimer and a qualification. First, I am not in favour of any substantial indulgence in any mind-altering drug but I believe we must live in the real world rather than the world of Miami Vice. Every single piece of historical evidence I can think of shows that some people will take these drugs and that the demand curve for them is highly inelastic. It does not matter how high the price goes, some people will always find the money, or kill themselves in the attempt.

Lastly, decriminalisation does not mean deregulation. We regulate the manufacture and distribution of the legal drugs, particularly with regard to who can use them, where you can buy them and what the production process must be.  We can do the same for any other drug.  Admittedly there are holes in the regulatory system but that is a fact of life in public health. Nobody ever suggested we try to outlaw influenza, nor that we cease harm minimisation campaigns simply because we cannot wipe it out altogether.

1.

This budget gives a 4/5 chance of preventing warming of greater than 2 degrees (the 'target' that has been agreed in the recent rounds of climate talks).

China needs to find a path to development and prosperity that doesn't involve the use of massive amounts of fossil fuels (which is the path the west has taken).

The sheer bulk of Chinese investment and the economies of scale present in their manufacturing industries could dramatically drop the cost of things like solar panels and components in other renewable technologies.

Wealthy persons and corporations (and unions) can easily influence the policies of those political parties whom they fund. Witness the national secretary of the Transport Workers Union threatening to withdraw funds from Labour if Gilliard is dumped as PM. The threat, or implied threat, of withdrawal from a major donor is inevitably going to influence political parties (and even government) policies.
The way in which large political donations damage our democracy which is not often mentioned is that campaign finances can and do win or lose elections. How much money a party has to throw around greatly affects the outcome of elections. Why else (except in order to obtain direct political favours) would people make such donations if not to try to get their preferred candidates elected. 
This clearly skews the democratic process in favour of the wealthy. Normal people can only influence elections with their single, solitary vote. But if you have money, you can wield far more influence than you own personal vote allows.
Even if we don't want to have a system whereby political parties are publicly funded, I think we must seriously consider a limit, and a fairly stringent one, on how much any individual or corporation can contribute.
Union contributions are a little different because they, at least in theory, represent their members, and are donating on their behalf. This being the case, I think union contributions should always be put to a general vote of their members, rather than being at the discretion of union officials.",,"",6,"",,"",,"",,"",6

Until recently I inclined to the view that China was just massively increasing carbon emissions in the pursuit of economic growth, with no regard for our environmental future or international cooperation.  However the story is more complex.  While it is true that China's emissions are by far the largest in the world, and are growing on an absolute and per capita basis, we also need to bear in mind:

1. A great deal of ""China's"" emissions are due to manufacturing goods consumed by richer countries, particularly Western developed countries.  So, who is really responsible for those emissions?  To whom should they be attributed?  Arguably the richer have relocated their emissions to China.  So we need a proper accounting which fairly attributes carbon emissions to those ultimately responsible, and is not simply based on the geographic location where they are produced. 

2. While it is true that China is massively increasing carbon emissions by e.g. building new coal-fired power plants, it is also making huge efforts of a more positive kind, including massive investments in renewables and reforestation.  The story here is very mixed, but the thing to bear in mind is that the sheer scale of what China is doing on the positive side. 

3. On a related point: if anything is going to ""save the planet"" it is, as John Daley pointed out in his presentation, the opening up of opportunities for self-interest to operate.  Currently the key development here is the dramatic fall in price of solar PV, potentially reaching a tipping point where solar will start rapidly forcing out fossil fuels simply because it is cheaper.  Why has this been happening?  While countries such as Germany have played an important role, my understanding is that in driving the economies of scale required to force the drop in price, China has been far more important than any other country.  

Malte Meinshausen explicitly addressed the question of who is leading the fight against climate change.  He said it is not China, not Europe, and not the US; rather it is micro-countries such as Costa Rica.   But if we're talking about countries whose positive efforts are going to make a difference on a global scale, on balance, you'd have to say, at the moment, it is China. ",,"",7,"",,"",,"",,"",7

There are three key metrics that should surely determine our judgment in this regard: (1) what is and will be for decades to come the proportion of its energy consumption generated by fossil fuels? (2) what are its net emissions from all sources, since this is what measures its impact on the problem; and (3) to what extent are its efforts in mitigating pollution (as distinct from CO2 emissions) primarily directed at making its own urban (and rural) environments more livable (as distinct from addressing any global common good)?

Enthusiasts like to talk up Chinese investments in renewables, but these amount to a vanishingly small proportion of Chinese energy investment and consumption. Coal remains and is set to remain for decades the chief source of power generation, and nuclear energy is also getting a lot of investment. Moreover, this would seem to be the case globally and whatever our feelings regarding what ought to be the case, it would be silly to stand in denial of the realities. I use that language quite deliberately, of course. The fact that China is clearly seeking to build more efficient coal fired power   plants is reason to believe that they intend to keep using coal, not reason to see them as particularly committed to a switch to renewables.

As regards points (2) and (3), as the current ""workshop of the world"" China is rapidly increasing its share of industrial pollution of all kinds. Those who assert that it is not to blame for this because the wealthier countries have exported their manufacturing industries to China forget that China has set out aggressively to attract and enhance exactly these industries. It may well be that others need to collaborate with it to solve certain problems, but it would be patently naive to suggest that China is innocent in any sense in this matter.

Finally, the idea that China is more effective because a totalitarian dictatorship is dangerously misleading. China continues to run an institutionally and financially highly inefficient economy and its problems of waste and pollution are vastly worse than those of the EU, the US or Japan.

The problem we have (on the face of it) is that ""basic human needs"" used to be those of hunting or agrarian cultures, but have now been redefined (very vaguely) in terms of industrial, electricity powered culture and for billions of humans instead of a few tens or hundreds of relatively impoverished humans.

If this solution saves just one life (to use the oft expressed view) from being lost at sea then it will be worth it.  Is the alternative palatable? No, not at all but if you were to ask those who have perished at sea, is it better to be alive and have a second chance than be dead with no chance, I am sure they would probably answer in the affirmative.
As someone who is against any form of holding genuine refugees, I would use this as the first step to getting a better quality of debate on the issue.  There are too many of us in Australia either through being uninformed or unaware who do not see the moral (and yes economic) benefits of supporting these people.

This issue has been a vexed one for quite some time and had become a matter of political gridlock. It is a striking indication of how our democratic institutions can prove unable to resolve important issues that the Greens, the ALP and the Coalition were unable or unwilling to reach a tripartisan consensus on moral, legal and economic grounds about how to set a boundary around arrivals of people by sea. The appointment of an independent panel was a recourse available to the Government to try to break the deadlock, assuming that doing so is a public good, the taking of this recourse was, I think, a responsible thing to do. The panel surely consisted of three individuals of integrity and repute, so there judgement in the matter surely deserves being given the benefit of the doubt. And there is no indication - unless I'm missing something - that this solution could never be modified. Indeed, Angus Houston has made clear that certain things will need to be addressed and changes made: the solution is provisional and transitional, not dogmatic or inflexible.

It should also be borne in mind that the panel was given a very short space of time to consult, reflect and report. It could be that they did not get it completely right. It could be, also, that a very different onshore regime might be manageable, but if so the case for it needs to be made temperately, transparently and persuasively, rather than militantly and self-righteously. Plainly, there is a deep-seated resistance to the idea of larger or unhindered flows of refugees arriving by sea. That sentiment cannot be disregarded even if it sits uneasily with the protocols of the UN convention on refugees. I think that the panel's work should now be used to simmer down political partisanship and serve as a basis for a better structured and more systematic debate on the overall character of refugee policy.

I will treat it as such.

The centrepiece of the policy is that asylum seekers arriving by boat should have ""no advantage"" over those in transit countries, such as Indonesia. Currently asylum seekers in these transit countries have no legal standing, no rights and no easy way to apply for refugee status and resettlement in a third country. At the end of the day the principal of ""no advantage"" means we must shirk our responsibilities as a country that believes in compassion, equality and a fair go for all. This is until such time as there are practical and accessible means for asylum seekers to apply for refugee status and resettlement in transit countries or they can be granted some sort of legal standing in those transit countries (that allows them to work, their children to attend school etc.).

The recommendations do support the establishment of regional frameworks and discuss a number of principals that should underpin such frameworks. However the report does not offer a concrete way forward for such a regional framework or, importantly, set a timeframe for achieving such a framework.

Without a regional approach in-place the interim policy would lead to a 'de-facto' Pacific Solution which was plagued with a poor human rights record, bad mental health outcomes for refugees, and was ultimately ineffective as the majority were eventually resettled in Australia. Even mandatory, indefinite detention may not work, as many may find it preferable to their current situation.

The report also ignores evidence. Past policies that prevented refugees from sponsoring family members encouraged entire family groups tomake dangerous boat journeys. These policies (like TPVs) have led to women and children dying at sea.

Until a real regional framework is in place the only option to reduce dangerous sea journeys is to remove the barriers to come to Australia safely. If people from 'risky' countries could get visas to FLY to Australia (and be treated like other asylum seekers who arrive by air), the problem of boat people would disappear overnight.

Firstly, to deal with the latter of the objections above; the recomendations clearly state (para 3.41) that the panel believes its recomendations to be consistent with Australia's international obligations.
Importantly, the panel's recomendations regarding an increase to the humanitarian intake, focussing on asylum seeker source countries, and impleneting various measures to see that people arriving ""irregularly"" obtain no advantage over those who apply for asylum through official channels, should remove any incentive to attempt risky maritime crossings. Whilst simultaneously providing refuge to more people desperately in need of our help.
Although I am concerned about the principle of ofshore processing, since the whole point of ofshore processing is to remove refugees from the legal protection of Australia's legal system, the provisions for protecting the rights of ofshore detainees (detailed in para 3.46) seem reasonable.
Likewise, the panel recognises that the Malaysia deal in its current form provides insufficient protection for refugees, and so it recommends strengthening these and arranging appropriate oversight of asylum seeker treatment before such a deal should be considered.

As for the report not offering a ""concrete way forward"", it is true that the report does not go into too many details on this, but it does recommend doubling the funding to those initiatives of this kind already in place, and focussing these intitiative near source countries.
I see these proposals, rather than the ""no advantage"" principle or offshore processing, as the cornerstone of the panels reccomendations.
If these proposals are not an essential part of any legislation, or if they are at all watered down, I could not possibly support such legislation.
If you read the report carefully (para 3.13 - 3.18) you will see that currently family reunion for irregular arrivals is given particular priority. The report merely recommends that this provision be removed and these application for reunion be dealt with under normal migration processes.

Here are some examples of some arguments and counterarguments I have encountered so far:

 - We want to deter arrivals by boat through people smugglers because they result in significant casualties. The recent increase in boat arrivals coinciding with Labor's allegedly weaker deterrents suggests that the Howard era policy was working in reducing dangerous boat arrivals, but it has also plausibly been argued that so called 'push' effects (the conditions in the refugees' countries of origin) are more significant than 'pull' effects (the relative desirability of arriving at Australia by boat) in explaining asylum seekers' behaviour. A rebuttal to this argument is that once asylum seekers have escaped their country of origin, they will travel to the country that offers the best conditions they can find and Australia could still make itself a less desirable destination than others, even if it could never offer worse conditions than those asylum seekers are fleeing from.

 - It is argued that giving preferential treatment to those with the means to hire people smugglers is unfair to those on waiting lists in refugee camps in Africa and elsewhere. On the other hand, if the boat people will arrive no matter what we do then we are faced with the dilemma of spending resources to hold them in detainment indefinitely in order to avoid letting them jump the queue when both they and the Australian taxpayer would be better off if we allowed them to become productive citizens.

 - Stopping the boats from coming might prevent some visible casualties, but the alternatives for many of those deterred may be worse in terms of suffering and risk of death. Yet we cannot possibly alleviate the suffering of all those in such inhumane circumstances and giving people smugglers the power to select for us the recipients of our compassion is not only unfair to all those who are pursuing asylum through official avenues, but would be handing over a dangerous amount of control over immigration to criminals.

I honestly have no idea what the best strategy to deal with asylum seekers is. The question we are trying to answer, however, is not whether the Expert Panel's proposal is the best approach, but whether it should be adopted. It should be emphasized that our choice is not between this proposal and the best possible approach, but between the panel's approach and continued deadlock, or something made in the sausage factory of politics. My appraisal of the Expert Panel is that its three members posess competence and integrity and that they have put a great deal of thought into their proposal.

There is an unpalatable aspect of human nature expressed in the cliché “out of sight, out of mind”. Australia seems to be experiencing the corollary of that with regards to boat people. We, obviously, have no obligation to care for all the citizens of other countries being oppressed by their rulers, even if in practice we could care for them all, but if by chance some of those oppressed (the wealthy ones) were brought in sight, such as on the 6 o’clock news after they had scuttled their boat offshore, then for some unknown reason we must do something.

But of course without private schools, the burden of educating all kids falls upon the State. 

But I guess you knew this. I really only included the topic because it seems to generate the most heat when I hear it discussed with neither side achieving the moral high ground in my view. 

As for your first point, I don't actually recall suggesting that every human had a natural right to live in Australia. As a person who came to this country from England, I have never stopped thanking my good fortune and this country's generosity in allowing me to live here. 

I think the point I was making is that to me it seems inhumane to ignore the claims of people who flee here for fear of their lives. Having lived for a short time once in Afghanistan, I can easily empathise with those refugees who are willing to risk their lives. I am not saying ""let everyone come in"" because I have an idea that this country would struggle to accommodate one or two billion less fortunate souls. 

But Ed, let us at least investigate the claims of these people when they turn to us for help. And, just for one moment, try to imagine how you would feel about this issue if you came from one of these strife-torn territories. Different, I bet.

While some aspects are good (e.g. the increased intake and the attempt to provide no advantage to any particular group of asylum seeker), the fact that we will be imprisoning innocents up offshore for indefinite periods is repugnant – and I don’t think it will work to reduce boat arrivals by any significant amount.  Further, the amount of those arrivals is tiny - approximately 6800 people in 2010.  What’s the big deal?  We are hardly in danger of being inundated!

So – we are taking legitimate refugees and imprisoning them, indefinitely.
Understand this – that is what this is. We are taking people who are fleeing horror, and then locking them up for an indeterminate period.  
We are doing this because...  Well, I don’t know.  They aren’t flooding us, they don’t take up much resources (Refugees have the same entitlements as all other permanent residents—they do not receive special refugee payments or special rates of payment), and I reckon that most become productive hard-working citizens in the end (this I do not have stats on, but I do have anecdotal knowledge).  In fact my partner is a boat person from the Vietnam era, and she is exactly that – a hard working and honest Australian, as are her entire family.  It is horrific to me to think of her suffering as current asylum seekers must suffer, for no reason that I can see - beyond the scoring of political points, or perhaps because of xenophobia!  Her family gave up everything they had and risked their lives in a leaky boat to flee persecution in Vietnam, with no fixed destination in mind (Australia agreed to take them in, but they did not seek to come here – they just wanted to go somewhere safe).  They did this because they were in great danger back in Vietnam!  Not so they could sponge welfare or lounge about on an Aussie beach!  
 My understanding is that push factors (i.e.  the cause of people fleeing their country in the first place) far outweigh pull factors (i.e.  the thing that draws them to seek a new home in places like Australia).  I feel that ideas like offshore processing in Nauru etc only address the perceived pull factor of Australia as an attractive place to migrate to.  But these people aren't migrating - they are fleeing.  And while I loathe our imprisonment of these people, crazily enough the imprisonment we inflict is likely a better alternative than what they face at home!  So they will still come!  (And no, the fact they flee worse suffering is not an excuse for imprisoning them – why should we inflict any suffering on legitimate refugees?)
I’d say another feature of offshore processing is that it removes these people from the eye and mind of the Australian public.  It lets us sleep at night, almost oblivious to suffering.  
Well, I’d rather not sleep while others live a waking nightmare!
What should we have done that we aren’t?  Well I think we need to work hard to get our queues moving (they aren’t), and we need to make sure asylum seekers know that avenue works, and then I think they will use it.
Perhaps we could also try to focus on the sources of the refugees – we could try to place Australian staff in Pakistan (for example) to try and assist Afghan refugees to come to Australia via our newly moving queues, rather than having them jump on leaky boats.  That’s one suggestion anyway.  
Or...  We can just admit we don’t care.  We revoke our signatures to the treaties we have signed, and tell asylum seekers to go elsewhere, because they will find no shelter here.  Those that still come - we can turn their boats around, or let them sink.  I think that would stop the boats.   Ruthless, but effective – and maybe even honest, because isn’t that what we want?  To stop the boats?
Or do we want to help refugees to be safe and have a better life?  
If we want the latter then I think we will do it by addressing the root causes – push factors, frozen queues, and the simple fact that these people are no threat to our wealth, or our way of life.
But these new recommendations will be adopted, and that will mean we will not address the root causes anytime soon.
This is a sad day for Australia.

While the other two are very ""qualified"" in their own fields ( a Defence Chief and a Foreign Affairs Secretary), they are not very qualified in the matter of refugees. The panel had no expert in Humanitarian Law, no representative of UNHCR, nobody from refugee resettlement services, and what about hearing from a refugee that has been through it all? My point is that with such a small panel, with a shortage of expertise, it is even more important to take a leaf out of the approach of scientific journals, and to get the paper reviewed by more experts.

My statement is that the recommendations do not ""adequately"" address the fundamental problems. Admittedly, I mainly read the summary of recommendations (shallow indeed!), and found them to be very wishy-washy.

Australia has a relatively insignificant problem with asylum seekers yet we jump up and down and demand we protect our borders when a few boats arrive. It's insignificant compared to forced migration throughout Africa, the middle east and even southern Europe. It's also insignificant compared with the number of actual ""illegal"" immigrants who arrive by plane to Australia. 

It should be a non-issue but oh how we love to be whipped into a frenzy to stop the boats!

I've always been opposed to off-shore processing. It's essentially putting the most vulnerable people on earth (including kids) into makeshift third-world camps for indefinite periods of time. This from one of the wealthiest nations on earth.

Tough? Nup. That's pathetic.

So boat arrivals don't bother me at all. What does bother me - and has challenged my traditional view - is the boats that don't arrive. 

It’s hard to change long-established views and I was close on this one. I essentially weighed up two evils – people drowning on boats versus people slowing dying and losing their minds in camps. 

I don’t believe that a move to off-shore processing will be enough of a deterrent to asylum-seekers. My understanding is that the push-factors make the difference – fleeing from war and poverty etc. It’s not about the “pull” factors (or lack thereof) in Australia.

So I don’t think this policy change will affect the first evil – drownings. If it changes I’ll be revisiting my views again, however we’re now left with a policy that inflicts terrible harm and cost on people, and inevitably our own community, as 95% of asylum claims are generally found to be genuine and they end up living here. 

I’m aware that the expert panel found that it would stop or slow the boards but of course it was going to. No disrespect to Angus Houston, Michael L'Estrange and Paris Aristotle but the expert panel was set up to create an out-clause for the government. 

Let’s hope it stops the boats that don’t make it.

And let’s hope we haven’t just given a few thousand people a nice big shot of prolonged mental illness that comes with indefinite detention.

The displacement and dislocation of families from their kinship and community networks in search of refuge in another country is a travesty of their rights and dignity. The deaths of men, women and children fleeing to safety is an unimaginable sorrow. Many more refugees perish without trace than those we hear about attempting the crossing between Indonesia and Australia. The deserts of North Africa are filled with the bleached bones of those that have perished attempting to make their way to the uncertainty of European sanctuary.While there may be permanent resolution for some individuals through temporary sanctuary, permanent resettlement in an alternative country or resolution of regional conflicts that enable a safe return home, the history and size of the problem are endemic and are unlikely to ever be completely resolved through the course of human history. 

So what contribution should Australia make to the amelioration of suffering, the protection of life and the provision of succour to the dispossed? The very best possible under the circumstances without the burden of carrying the cross for all of humanity.

The reality of our present political circumstances had produced an impasse a consequence of which hundreds of people were perishing at sea. The unequivocal expectations of the majority of Australians was that a solution be promulgated by the parliament and any necessary action taken to immediately stop people drowning at sea while attempting to get to Australia. Of secondary importance was were these people were taken: Manus, Nahru or Malaysia or back to Indonesia. Each of which is still alive as an option over the medium term depending on which party wins governement next year. The other components of the package including the increase in the refugee intake and beefed up support components barely raised a public eyelid. However, the option that would have been completely rejected by the majority of the Australian public was the open door policy of the Greens which as it stands continues to set back implementation of more humane approaches than those arrived at by the panel. Nonetheless, the panel has delivered the best possible set of arrangements under the circumstances to obviate the need to place life at jeopardy to secure immediate safety and support and the prospect of permanent relocation to Australia or another third country.

Unless we have more young people entering the work force, the tax base will shrink rapidly as large numbers of older Australians retire. At the same time, many of these older people will require public support, either in the form of pensions etc., and certainly in the form of health care.
It is I think important to say that we should not regard these older Australians who will need public assistance as a burden, most of them have worked very hard their whole lives to make Australia prosperous, so they deserve all the assistance we can give them in their old age.
I think the best solution would be:
1) to scrap the baby bonus immediately; we don't need to give people financial incentives to have children.
2) in order to meet the challenge of a decreasing tax base, maintain or increase our SKILLED migrant intake, and reduce all other immigration to a minimum.
3) so as not to exacerbate the ageing population problem, perhaps we should consider an age cap on migration, or at least reserving the majority of places to young people.
4) in addition to skilled migration, we could significantly increase our humanitarian intake, but it is important that we do everything we can to help these people become productive members of Australian society. (Believe it or not, I strongly suspect that most of them WANT to be productive, rather than bludging off our social security system)
Although it may seem here that my proposals largely favour a 'big' Australia, I make thes concessions onl;y insofar as they are needed to meet the ageing population problem. Anything beyond that, say expansion on purely economic grounds, is unjustified. As is correctly pointed out above, unlimited expansion only works if you have unlimited resources.
While I have great faith that improvements in technology and infrastructure will help us make more out of our limited resources, they are already stretched as it is.

But by the mid 70s, we'd lost our nerve. A lot of this was sparked by the oil crisis. Doomsdayers said that the world was now overpopulated, and was headed for a crisis in food and energy. And that we were heading for the same disaster.

Forty years later, Australia has almost double the population and we're all significantly richer in real terms. And we don't appear to be running out of fuel or food. In fact, we keep discovering new ways to generate electricity - whether it's the monumental reserves of LPG we've barely started to tap or the flowering of wind farms. 

But what about food? Well, Australia currently produces $60 billion in agricultural products. But we only consume $20 billion. That leaves $40 billion worth of food that we happily export to the world. And we'd export a lot more if world food prices weren't so low. Or, more relevantly, if there were more hungry Aussies. I know my family on the Riverina would be producing a lot more grapes, oranges and avocados if the local market was a bit bigger. 

Agriculture is just one example of how a bigger Australia would bring good things. There's no doubt that it would add to our economy massively. One of the reasons we're so wealthy today (remembering that Australia is now the only nation in the OECD with 20 straight years of growth) is that we had a baby bulge in the 70s. That's right it was in the 70s, not the 50s. And all those people are now in the peak of their productivity and their consumption. If we don't plan for a bigger Australia, then once those folks start living less productive lives, it's all going to become a bit of a strain. The sooner we start planning for fresh faces in this country, the better off we'll all be. 

Not forgetting, of course, that parts of world really are overcrowded, and would like to come here to work and play. Often they come from nations that really don't know how to get an economy running. Let's bring a few more of them in here - solving some of those nation's problems - and helping to solve a whole bunch of ours.

At the end of the day it doesn't matter if Australia's population is 22 million, 30 million or 50 million. None of these populations are sustainable under current resource consumption and waste generation. This is where the challenge lies - reducing our per capita consumption of non-renewable resources.

Like it or not this is also a debate about immigration - Australia's birth-rate is below the replacement rate - and future population growth will mainly come from this source. I believe we do need to have a discussion (unfortunately it's not likely to be a particularly informed one) about how best to manage temporary and permanent immigration to Australia, but it's one that shouldn't be dressed up as a conversation about environmental sustainability.

Globally population growth is a problem, however population is expected to peak sometime this century. The best way to reign in growth?

If I became convinced that we would not or could not do these things, I would tend to become more conservative. And I understand that fears of these things NOT being managed well shape the advocacy of zero population or minimal population growth.

Whether here or overseas the debate about the 'carrying capacity of the Earth' is a wonderfully complex one. Our own case is peculiar in two ways: we live in a quite unusually arid continent and we are unusually prosperous and urbanized. There is, on these latter grounds alone, never mind wider global concerns, a plausible case to be made that we would be unwise to seek a massive growth in our population. However, there are several points to be made in favour of planning for and welcoming a significantly larger population. The most evident of these are a domestic market for innovations, manufactures and commodities and a capacity to defend ourselves. These are classic arguments for having a substantial population, especially in a very large land mass. The argument that we are running out of food and energy or environmental goods is dubious, even if the argument for being responsible and strategically thoughtful about them is well taken. 

The fact that our population is growing and that benefits can and do come from this points to there being a bigger Australia (say 35 million by mid-century), but is that a 'BIG Australia? Or would a big Australia be a 50 or even 100 million Australia, sometimes called for my business magnates? We need to acknowledge that there is a considerable elasticity in the term 'BIG' here. The ideal population in China, for example, might well be 300 million (a 75% decrease), whereas ours might be 35 to 50 million without an overshoot (a 100% increase).

The onus is on those who want to expand the population to demonstrate unambiguously how it can be achieved without further destruction to biodiversity and ecosystems, and without further degradation to what are the very foundations of both the economy AND the environment i.e. air, soil and water.

There is an argument that we can 'manage' the problems and politely ask others to voluntarily stop consuming so much, but we all know that will never achieve anything unless we're staring an environmental catastrophe right in the face.  But even then, after 200 years of ecocide on Australia's native species as well as the slow-motion catastrophe of climate change, we've arguably ticked the catastrophe box twice already.

(1) The rest of the world wants the maximum supply of food possible.  More Australians = more domestic consumption, and thus less food available for export.

(2)  The way Australia wants to grow is by *economic* migration. Yes we do take some refugees, but the number is pathetic in comparison to the economic intake.  Australia is basically a parasite that trawls the world looking to strip mine the best and brightest individuals away from the developing nations who need them the most.   Go to a country like Bangladesh or Nepal and ask them where all the doctors, nurses and engineers are.  It's an international disgrace.  Sure, the migrants might send a few bucks back for their few remaining relatives for a couple of years, but an entire class (including future generations) of educated, middle class workers is being unethically poached by countries like Australia, Canada and the US, leaving the most vulnerable countries hollowed-out shells.

The other issue with your analysis is that you appear to be arguing the edges of the classic ""safety-valve"" fallacy i.e. any country can do the world a favour by absorbing excess population from other countries.  But it doesn't work.  Why?  Demography 101.  Reducing numbers in an area under population pressure simply creates a vacuum that is promptly filled.  Looking at Bangladesh again: if there is food for 150 million people, there is likely to always be at least 150 million people until such time as you have a social security system (or until the environment collapses under the weight).  Without social security, most underdeveloped world parents have no choice but to maximise the number of children they have so they can ensure they are properly looked after in old age.  Otherwise they are out on the street.  Often brutally. Any reasonable person would do the same in the same situation.  Add up all similar families and the population grows to meet the available food supply.  The 'safety-valve' achieved nothing.

Meanwhile Australia doubled its population to 'help' the rest of the world, absorbing just 100 days of world growth to grow by another 22 million, leaving the Australian environment under extreme pressure, and leaving the 'donor' country no better off - in fact worse off because we only took their young, educated, wealthy, middle class workers... 

It's not a good answer.  Not that your plan isn't entirely without merit though.

If it encourages investment in housing, but in doing so pushes prices sky-high and significantly diminishes government income from taxation, then the unwanted effects probably outweigh the benefits.

The downside to abolishing negative gearing is the potential negative effect on the economy. However, cheaper house prices would also translate into lower mortgage repayments and more disposable income for the average person, which would have a positive economic effect. Cheaper housing would also encourage more owner-occupiers to buy houses, which would help to support the market.

It’s important to remember that even if negative gearing was abolished, the costs of investing in housing and shares could still be claimed – but only on the income generated by those investments, and not against other income, such as salaries. (So rjp’s ‘against’ statement in favour of quarantining negative gearing from other income sources should actually be a ‘for’ vote!) There would still be tax incentives for investing in assets, and housing investors could still ""install a tenant to assist with the mortgage repayments"" (gyoung), because the interest and other expenses could still be claimed against the rental income.

Finally, most of the debate here focuses on negative gearing as it relates to housing rather than shares; so maybe it would be worth considering the two separately – especially since shares are an ‘optional extra’ for most people, while housing is a necessity.

We don't have as much choice as you might think.  Long term, the rate of growth has to average very close to zero.    Let me demonstrate:

If humans evolved out from 2 individuals about 300,000 years ago, then the rate of growth to get to 7 billion today works out at less than 0.0001% per year.

The physicist Albert Bartlett went so far as to work out that if the bible was right and that the first 2 humans existed around 5000 B.C., and the rate of growth since then was unchecked at just 1.7% per annum (less than what Australia grew by in 2008 and 2009) then the following would take place:

(1) by the year 3100 B.C. the population density on land would have reached 1 person per square metre on Earth.

(2) by the year 2000 B.C. the mass of the human population would equal the mass of the Earth.

(3) by today, the world would be a ball of human flesh ten thousand times the size of the solar system, and expanding outwards at the speed of light!

Gotta love the power of compound interest.  

So you can't keep up growth for any significant length of time.  At the 2009 rate of increase, Australia will grow 60-fold to 1.4 billion within 200 years.

I recall a documentary about the human race that explained that the population growth we experience now is a historical anomaly.

In addition, it’s not even true to say that population growth today is inevitable. Japan is a serious case in point. Apparently, at current reproduction rates, the Japanese race will extinguish in as little as a few hundred years (I can’t recall the exact time). The Japanese government is very concerned.

In the end, I think that growth is still a desirable option and the point still turns on the rate of growth that we think is in our interests. For example, if we’re talking about a population of 50 million (just to use a number others have used here), the question then really is when do we want to achieve that figure? By 2050, 2100, 2200?

We should be looking at reducing the overall catch – from ALL ships – as this would actually address the issues of devastated fish stocks, by-catch and destruction of key species in the food chain. But banning this ship is too simplistic. The result would be others will take up the catch.


The Margiris gives people who are not engaged with the issue of sustainability an excuse to sign a petition, change their facebook status and be generally outraged at this “outsider ruining our fisheries” without having to lift a finger or actually change their own behaviour. It’s the Kony of the oceans.


The Margiris will catch the same amount as a smaller ship would – just in less time. You ban this ship the fish and by-produce will be caught by others.


You want more sustainable fisheries and less depletion of oceans? Don’t eat or buy from places that sell orange roughy (deep sea perch), blue grenadier, striped marlin or southern bluefin tuna.

This is because I do not think that Australia's fragile environment can truly sustainably accommodate a large population.  My understanding is that much of the country is too marginal for the support of any real population.  

Also, the supposedly agriculturally productive parts aren't as productive as they may seem (although we do grow much of our own food) because they require artificial means to regenerate fertility - the nutrients in Australian soil were put down gradually over a long period, and once gone, they stay gone.  In essence farming in Australia 'mines' the nutrients from the soil.  Further, advanced agricultural practices tend to mobilize high salinity and cause significant erosion, making it even more difficult over time to keep land productive.

I understand that Australia also has significant water issues - issues that may well be exacerbated by overpopulation.

Therefore, if my information is correct, I do not feel Australia will be a wealthier and better place with a large population.  Instead we will be more dependent on others, and probably have a poorer standard of living.  Water and food are simply too fundamental a factor – without an adequate supply of either it will be difficult to ensure quality of life.

The arguments against it are very weak. 45 jobs certainly isn't a lot, and it seemed to me that if there was a risk of overfishing, then the jobs of smaller fishing operations would be at risk.

These guys are not in the charity business!
However, after reading about the basis on which the catch limits are set, and about the minimal level of by-catch and the procedures in place to make sure that it IS minimal, (see  http://tasmaniantimes.com/images/uploads/SPF_discussion_paper_%28FINAL%29.pdf , and http://www.afma.gov.au/2012/06/super-trawler-faqs/ ) the arguments for the ban seem to be misguided.
The best scientific evidence available suggests that the species of fish in question are in no danger of being overfished, the marine ecosystem in this part of the world is quite diverse, so predator species are not in particular danger in any case, the levels of by-catch for this type of trawling are minimal and procedures are in place both to monitor by-catch and to make sure by-catch iremains minimal, and laastly the age of the stock assessments has already been taken into account in determining the catch quotas. These quotas are deliberately conservative.

On the one hand fish are tasty, nutritious and a source of income for many coastal populations. On the other hand fishing can lead to damage to marine ecosystems (either through overfishing, by-catch or damage to the seafloor and corals) and the collapse of fisheries. 

Although the Margiris has turned out to be a lightening rod issue, it's distracting attention (although conservationists could use the issue to educate the public more about sustainable fisheries) from the complexities of fisheries management.

It may be the case that the catch allowed for the Margiris or for the fishery it is in is too high. If this is the case it obviously shouldn't be allowed to fish there. But a blanket ban on a ship due to its capacity to catch and process fish isn't the solution. There could be other Australian fisheries that it could operate in sustainably. Or there may not be - but the decision needs to be based around each fishery's capacity and good solid (and independent) research and monitoring.

I hope that the controversy surrounding the Margiris leads to more government investment in fisheries research (as some of the studies for the Margiris' proposed operating zone are woefully out of date) so this precious resource can be managed in a way that it will be there for future generations.

Their is a lot of ocean and we need to start consuming a more diverse range of species from this huge natural resource. As affluence increases it would appear the consumption of higher trophic species also increases, consumers have preferences for minimal to zero bones, large single serve fillets and minimal to nil preperation prior to cooking. As a result we have seen a lot of the larger bodied species such as salmon, tuna, swordfish, flathead and blue eye to name a few become the dominant species available at fish mongers.

The rapid growth in aquaculture in the 90's drove a demand for cheap meal and also requires wild caught fish oil to add to the fish diets to boost their long chain omega-3 content, specifically EPA and DHA. Scientists and the community realised you could not rely on fish proteins to fatten the stock and as a result a very concerted effort in the aquaculture sector globally has lead to the fish in, fish out ratio being bought down to a far more sustainable level. This is great news for the small pelagic fish and also opens the door way for the large trawler fleets to explore higher value markets for this fish as opposed to meal. Due to the high oil content, small bodies and inability to rapidly gut the fish they need to be frozen whole rapidly to reduce the chance of spoilage. This either limits vessels without freezer capacity to a geographical extremity dictated by their onshore freezer or you need a freezer trawler.

The best bits in it were quotes from article and books in the 1960s and 70s about how growth was going to kills us all. 

In the '70s, the thought was the industrial demands of the population would necessarily mean we'd choke the atmosphere with the pollutants we need to put out to keep it all going. So, here's the quote from the January issue of LIfe Magazine, ""Scientists have solid experimental and theoretical evidence to suport... the following predictions: In a decade, urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution... by 1985 air pollution will harve reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half."" 

It was the same apocalyptic vision with regards human population. 

Paul Ehrlich wrote in ""The Population Bomb"" in 1970, that the sub-continent would starve itself: ""The train of events leading to the dissolution of India as a viable nation"" was already in progress. 

Denis Hayes, the organiser of the first Earth Day in 1970 said, ""It is already too late to avoid mass starvation.""

What has actually happened, in India and most other countries, is that the death rate has fallen, food production has massively increased - so that food prices, worldwide, are at record low. And the net worth of citizens in almost every nation has grown.

This is a story of relative changes in the balance of power and influence, not an inexorable collapse of Western civilisation as we know it.

The other point I'd make is that we're in the midst of globalisation in many spheres. As noted in the first ""against"" point in the ""explainer"", Western civilisation has permeated so many aspects across the world. What I'd suggest is that ""civilisational"" differences are not as meaningful in a globalised world as they might have been in the past: ""civilisations"" are coming into contact with each other, interacting with each other, and changing each other.

China and India have the fastest growing rate of millionaires in the world (the number of millionaires in the US is falling) and the burgeoning middle class in these countries are increasingly living western lifestyles (which is coming with all sorts of western problems like diabetes).

A couple of prelim notes: (1) I don't think the decline of Western civilization is necessarily going to be a bad thing per se and (2) I don't agree with Ferguson's position mentioned in the links that this civilization will ""collapse"" just like the Romans or whatever: the world of today works differently from the world of antiquity, as others on the ""against"" side have said, and I can't actually envision what form ""collapse"" would actually take.

However, I think Western civilization in any meaningful sense is going to disappear. It will be slow and maybe not even immediately perceptible to people going through the process.

On the one hand, Western civilization has had global influence and parts of it have made its way into countries all over the planet. I defer to the against side on that point. However, as time goes on and countries with different cultures and traditions rise (China and India in the medium run, who knows who else in the long run), I see the process going the other way - whereas we're used to seeing West penetrate East (or more generally Non-West), I think the direction of those cultural flows is going to be changing in the not-too-distant future, and it's going to be a decisive change of direction. Countries with non-Western roots - in Africa, Asia, south America and so on - vastly outweigh those with Western roots purely on raw population numbers. As those countries start to develop political and social influence proportional to their raw size, their ability to influence human society and culture will necessarily increase as well.

Some of the things that we conceive of being ""of the West"" - its historical memory, its intellectual contributions to the world, its culture - will stay in one form or another, but as a civilization, I see the West as slowly and inevitably declining.

The growing disparity in wealth and income between the rich and poor is a danger sign. The transition of the middle class from aspirational spenders to barely surviving working poor is another. It is easy to get apocalyptic and predict disaster - and I think there is a good chance of collapse. But reform and recovery is possible, if there is concerted global action and a reorientation of values in the next 5-10 years. Even then there will be a massive crunch as the baby boomers die age, and a relative recovery as they die off. So I don't think it is definitely terminal.

Yes, China and India are rising economic forces.
Yes, the USA at the very least is in serious economic decline (not just relative economic decline) and is also in decline in terms of international politics.
Increasingly, Middle-Eastern countries are seriously resisting western political influence to the extent that the Arab League is emerging as at least a somewhat effective force in the region.
Russia, which we had all hoped would join the west after the fall of the Soviet Union, is telling the west to get stuffed, and is generally siding with China against the US.
Politically and economically, the west is perhaps being eclipsed, but it seems unlikely that, at least in the short term this is going to be 'terminal' (ah, it seems I can't avoid making predictions after all)
As some have noted, western 'values' are however increasingly pervading non-western cultures.
Unfortunately the most successful of these 'values' appears to be consumerism (I use the word consumerism rather than materialism because materialsim more properly refers to a metaphysical theory which claims that there are no 'supernatural' entities in the universe)
More encouraging is that values like democracy are making some headway in India (I know it technically is a democracy already but a horribly corrupt one) the Middle-East, and even in China in a small way.
Values like equality for women are even making some headway in many countries (we should remind ourselves that this is only a recent value in the west itself).
It all depends on what you think a civilisation consists in.
To my mind, if you want to talk generally about 'western civilisation', it is the culture and values that matter, and although the west comes out of a christian heritage, it is secular humanism that really defines what I think is worth keeping about western culture.

They, in turn, preserved a good deal of the Roman heritage, adopted the Roman religion (Catholicism), made various technological innovations and eventually rediscovered Greek learning and science, which triggered what we call the renaissance (rebirth) and reformation - then the Enlightenment.

During the years in which the Germanic kingdoms were fighting it out, Islam was ascendant in the Mediterranean basin (having conquered first most and eventually all of the Byzantine empire) and China flourished under the Tang and Song dynasties. But the decline of Rome indirectly created the conditions for the revitalization of the West. Why does this matter? Because our current challenges could (I emphasize the word could) be the harbinger of a scientific and cultural renewal. 

That renewal could itself be what we are seeing in global civilization (China, India and so on) or it could be germinating in ways as yet scarcely visible. And this is important, because if we want a vital future for Western civilization, it is neither the trajectory stemming from the past nor the influence of that past on others that should be our central focus, but what we ourselves are doing to replenish and enrich the civilization we have inherited.

This could be in part because the word ""terminal"" seems too definitive and also too gloomy. But if by ""terminal decline"" we mean a falling away from a state that will never be attained again, it seems to me a good case can be made that Western civilization is, indeed, in terminal decline. 

Consider the key arguments: 

(1)Western geopolitical dominance has been declining for many decades. Begun by the Europeans, it passed to America in 1945, but now America is transparently in all sorts of trouble and it is by no means evident that it can turn its decline around. 

(2) Demographically, the West is on a slippery slope and is being massively out-bred by Africans, Arabs, Indians and Chinese. This isn't a racist observation. It's an arithmetical one. The populations of the West are literally in terminal decline, in the sense that they are dying off. 

(3) Western civilization is best understood as the classical and Christian traditions, but these are in serious and arguably terminal decline pretty much throughout the West. The reasons are complex and the fact that this decline is occurring is not necessarily an altogether bad thing, but it does seem to be both real and terminal. 

(4) If you respond that Western civilization is ""really"" the scientific and industrial culture that sprang from the Enlightenment, you may or may not be correct (there is room for debate about this), but that culture is arguably in serious trouble; not because technology has failed to produce wonders but because those very wonders look as though they have failed produce better human beings. Instead they have produced far too many human beings who are collectively despoiling the planet and who continue to build ever more horrendous means for killing one another and ingenious schemes for looting and defrauding one another. Science itself is under siege and is less embedded in the moral and intellectual culture even of the West than we might like to think. It is most certainly not embedded elsewhere in the world.

I have not seen anyone on the ""FOR"" side address these arguments. All the talk of it being too early to make a call, or the West being the last best hope of mankind or a model for the rest of the world is all very well by way of staking out a preferred position; but what substantive realities support that position?

The second dialogue is between groups of people who have links to people in power. Sometimes these groups are transparent and democratic (perhaps law reform commissions, or some NGOs). More often they are completely self-interested groups of elites who are only interested in sustaining their own power. Unions and business organisations are the most obvious examples. These groups are able to influence decision-making and policy far more than electors, first because they have the power and opportunity to make elaborate and detailed submissions to government, and secondly because there is so much personal overlap between politicians and lobbyists. Donations to political parties only exacerbate this.

We need to balance these two dialogues, because it is clear that the electoral dialogue is not meaningful enough, and that the elite dialogue is too important.

But I'll address them one by one.

1) Because it is happening whether we like it or not?  
Not true,  the Federal government sets population growth targets of which is primarily source from immigration.  If current trends continue, our population growth will be overwhelmingly (2 thirds or higher) from migrants and the children of migrants.

2) Because it can offset the challenges of an ageing society.  
No.  Our primary dependants are our young, not our elderly who contribute in many important ways.  Please stop using the elderly to further your self-serving interests.  The ever increasing level of immigration is the primary cause of issues we are facing, a far cry from any form of solution.  Infrastructure costs go well beyond the benefits of increasing our population year upon year.  Steady-state economies are better for everyone including those currently benefiting from growth.  The growth paradigm will ultimately strangle itself (as it is), whereas a steady-state economy will survive and no growth doesn't mean no profit.  Growth is a lost cause.

3). Because of its economic benefits.  
No, categorically no.  The rate of population growth has outstripped the tax base and does not contribute significantly in productivity.  It further ensures our trade deficits outstrip our ability to repay whilst discouraging investment in true productivity and training the people already here.  We should be adopting immigration policies which aren't onerous on the existing population.  It's hard to imagine a crueller thing that could be done than subject the Australian people to year after year, decade after decade of forced population growth.  And we must realise that the economy is beholden to the ecology.  Further, economic benefits have for too long been touted as the be-all whilst ignoring the casualties along the way.  What value can you put on wiping out entire species?  What do we tell our children when we've watched the last wild Koala go under a bulldozer?

4). Because we can afford the infrastructure and housing.  
No, we can't.  We are much worse off now than we have ever been.  We have an ailing health service which now has people waiting 4+ years for elective surgery.  Our states are broke and infrastructure deficit needs now tally into the tens of billions and are causing significant loss of productivity.  Increasingly, we are moving to user-pays arrangements..  To suggest we can pay for it is patently false.
 
5). Because we will have enough food and water.  
No.  Water restrictions are commonplace now and it wasn't so long ago that we had a major drought which you appear to be totally ignorant of.  We are increasingly losing productive assets and capacity.  Continuing with this trajectory insures we are going to lose our most important water resources e.g. the Murray-Darling.

6). Because we can still protect the environment.  
This isn't happening now, what makes you think we'll be better at it at 35,60, 100 million?  Why should we continue to pave over good land, mow down Koalas, Numbats, Wombats etc in the pursuit of something which is not for the common good?  

7) Because social cohesion will remain strong.  
I'm not really seeing anything to inspire confidence in this regard.  Historically, whenever Australia has had large-scale immigration from other cultures, there's been unrest and division.  Increasingly, we are unable to provide opportunities for those who are here and those who come with un/underemployment of 17.5% according to Roy Morgan.  This means we have a growing number of disenfranchised.  We further have some 2 million who regularly need to resort to food bank because the costs of living have sky-rocketed due to population growth.  It is almost certain that we'll see growing deterioration of social cohesion if we do not change course and allow Australia's population to stabilise.  

Population stabilisation is inevitable.  We either do it now or leave it to the usual methods, war, famine, pestilence.  Personally, I'd sooner we start behaving like rational beings who realise there is nowhere else to go (at least for some time if ever).  We have to make it here and we should start taking responsibility for what we leave future generations.  I wonder if Hartwich and Brown have children or friends with children?  Why are they so keen on consigning them to rapidly declining quality of existence?

Our current growth and consumption based model seems unsustainable – we rely on growth when we may be hitting the limits of growth, barring an unexpected technological fix (these do occur though, so shouldn’t be discounted).  The impacts of this seem to be declining standards of living, increasingly unfair distribution of wealth, and great (and increasing) environmental damage.  This model, combined with the fact we are hitting limits seems to be the core issue I think.  

Related to the above is a more immediate issue – namely that we have artificially manipulated our financial systems to give the illusion of growth where it has not necessarily occurred.  This has been done by the manipulation of debt and money supply.  This has essentially led to the gaming of the system and has badly distorted real wealth and the systems of economic production.  Our governments and people have lost touch with the fact that money is in fact a symbol of wealth and not wealth itself, and that to achieve true growth we must actually research new knowledge, produce things (including food and useful software) that are useful or truly in demand (and not in a way that features planned obsolescence), provide services that directly support producing these things or maintaining quality of life (e.g.  health, and arts and entertainment to a point).  Any service or activity that is not doing this in a fairly direct fashion is quite probably parasitic activity on our systems (e.g.  Much of the world’s current financial activity, hollow celebrities etc).  Note – I am not saying financial activity is not useful – I think financiers etc once did a fine job of funnelling wealth where it needed to be to support productive activity, but nowadays they don’t seem to be doing this very well.  In essence, Western finance has gone rogue.

Western pursuit of purely financial efficiency over true systemic robustness and production has also led to a dangerous hollowing out of the entire Western economic system.  Essentially this is a kind of ‘Dutch disease’ that vastly reduces our self-reliance as nations, and means we are becoming one-trick financial/management ponies.  True productivity and thus wealth generation, as well as the ability to physically control that wealth, is increasingly heading off to the ‘rest’ of the world.  This is clearly dangerous if we wish to remain independent – or even wish to continue to function.

We are also horribly exposed to normalcy bias, thinking things cannot go wrong, when they really can.   In fact, if Nassim Taleb (of Black Swan fame) is correct the modern world’s complexity has become so great that random events can now do utterly terrible things to us.  This issue applies to all, not just to the West, but in the West we are perhaps more vulnerable to a true paradigm shifting catastrophe because we are so insulated from lesser ones, and because our systems are centralised, inflexible, and lacking in diversity and are therefore not robust .  The economic issues we are seeing right now could be a slow motion version of such a catastrophe – and climate change is another and even greater such threat.  While this also applies to other cultures to some degree, it is most evident in the highly developed, specialised, globalised Western economies.   I fear the West is becoming increasingly unable to adapt to great change.

Indeed, our populations have become too comfortable, and divorced from our real needs.  We are too protected from real life and events.  We feel too entitled where no entitlement exists and pursue these to destructive ends (does the natural world provide an entitlements?  No.  These are purely a human constructs, and while social safety net is valuable to a point, a sense of entitlement is not!).   Too many unproductive distractions abound for our citizens.  This means the average Western citizen is both very unprepared for change and also not paying attention to the very dangerous developments that are going on around us.  We also lack respect for our environment (which ultimately supports everything we do), and have a weak understanding of what is a real necessity in life, where and how these necessities are produced, and how these necessities and the environment are linked together.  Not that I am saying we have to be living in some sort of hippy commune, in touch with nature, but if we allow lives to move too far away from the natural world, we will tend to take more than can be renewed, and to use what we have taken for foolish ends.  In the end this shall undo us.  

We have become flabby, spoilt, and complacent.  We place too much value on our own lives and security – so much so that we both give away our freedoms and also over-react militarily to minor threats such as terrorism.  This costs us our wealth as well.  Honestly – terrorism is such a tiny threat we would be better to take a few intelligent steps (like locking/armour-plating airline pilots cabin doors – already done) and getting on with our live (for more on this, check out Bruce Shneier).  We do not even let our children take chances while they grow – and how are they ever to learn if they cannot make mistakes, even harmful ones? 

Much of our apathetic population do not think for themselves and swallow easy answers put about by a corrupted media who chase only dollars, and who are themselves addicted to the 24 hour news cycle.  Feeling has replaced thought.  Impulse has replaced contemplation.  Dependency has replaced pragmatism and responsibility.

Our governments are short-sighted and fixated on popularity at the expense of governing.  We allow moneyed interests to essentially bribe our politicians via lobbying.  In the rare cases where a major government party shows any kind of conviction, it is usually a result of ideology, not considered thought.  

We do not listen to our scientists and academics – the very people that probably hold the answers to our problems – instead we listen to shock jocks, religious leaders, and monumentally overpaid (and largely unproductive relative to their remuneration) CEOs and financiers.  Note – I do except those true entrepreneurs in our community (and no, that does not include mining magnates and their ilk who inherited a great deal of cash, and then claim to be entrepreneurs).

All of this is sowing the seeds of disaster for the West.  We can no longer generate wealth because we do not understand how.  Instead we print money (in effect) and generate debt.  These are false symbols of wealth, not wealth itself.  We are too asleep, too lazy, too greedy, and too fearful to turn aside from bad decisions.  We are no longer hungry for anything except security and comfort.  We do not listen to those who think and question, but instead to those who offer simple answers and speak with the fervent conviction of faith or monetary power.

Yet when I see something like the recent Kickstarter to support the (re-starting) of LiftPort, a business ultimately aiming to build a space elevator, I see that the West still has ambitions and vision.  When I look at the wonder that is the Internet I see we have a tool that (while free of government control) can truly support the best of human thought and allow lightning fast communication, education,  and cohesiveness – perhaps even some sort of new democracy.  When I read works like Nassim Taleb’s ‘The Black Swan’ or speak to my scientist friends, I see that those who see and think do still exist.  
This all gives me hope.

What else could be done to grow this hope?  I have a few (crazy?) ideas – training in logic, critical thinking, and research should become mandatory in schools, children should be taught the basics of blue collar trades (to build self sufficiency and to show the distinction between doing and knowing, between the physical world and the abstract world of thought), and (really crazy idea) children should also be taught basic survival skills and made to live in nature for a time, perhaps through mandatory education by groups like the scouts (let me elaborate before you swear and turn away - when I was visiting Vanuatu a few years back I had the privilege of visiting a school there which, along with normal education, required its students to live in the wild and provide for themselves for several weekends every quarter.  I also talked to a graduate of this school – and he was an impressively wise and able individual.  Partly because of this I myself have done some reasonably intensive wilderness training, and while not gaining much wisdom, I have gained increased respect for the natural world and our place in it, and have also gained an increased understanding of the privileged life which I lead as Western citizen).  I think these will provide the foundations for more capable adults – people who do question, who are inquisitive, who  respect what they have because they know what it is like to not have, and who are more self-reliant

We also need to ban direct donations to political parties, and figure out some way to have a free press that is not solely focussed on profits. We need to increase the voice and influence of science.  We need to encourage tolerance of all but intolerance. 

We need to let people and organisations fail when they should (compassionately where that is possible, but not taken to the point of undermining the failure or unreasonably socialising the pain).  And to learn from those failures if they can.  We need to let people take risks and explore, to think and adventure.

We need to try to prevent our populations becoming split between the very rich and the very poor.  Somehow we need to protect the middle classes (but not through cash handouts as a core policy).  I think implementing some of the above ideas may help in this. 

We need to reduce or eliminate the rewards for parasitic or useless activities and scale back the rewards for those somewhat useful activities which become rewarded beyond all reason (e.g. I again cite celebrities, particularly those born of nothing but sensation.  It makes no sense for a movie star to earn millions, let alone a contestant from Big Brother!).  This last I acknowledge to be particularly difficult (after all, who defines what is useless?), but it is worth examination.  

Perhaps then the West will arrest its decline.  But given these are big asks, and given the entrenched interest and apathy standing against them, I am not confident.

But I hope I am wrong.

Multiculturalism is a grownup approach to handling societies that are increasingly made up many demographics. In fact, I blanch at what might be the alternative - humiliation, revilement, repression of anyone different from ourselves? Would this help? I must assume that that is not what is being proposed by those who claim the policy should be dumped, but I fail to see what possible alternative there could be to respect and inclusion, in any society that prides itself on democratic practice and, well... respect and inclusion.

The unrest at Cronulla suggested to me that more work needs to be done to work through in the community the kind of fear and resentment that leads to xenophobia - and this is done best through multicultural policies. i would contend that Cronulla-type attitudes owe a lot to the kind of nationalistic, anglo-centric policies of the Howard years.

Similarly, it is patently obvious that the extremists at the socalled Islamic riots in Sydney suffer from resentments built up over many years of often racist jibes and differences, as well as some cultural differences. These problems, also obviously, will not be best approached by activities that inflame resentment. They were very well confronted, indeed and in the spirit of multiculturalism, by the leaders of those communities themselves, calling on hot-heads to recognise the practices of the country they live in, Australia.

Currently we are having some issues with Muslims, but these kind of teething issues are common enough when you get a new wave of migrants moving into the country (we've had various yellow peril phases, and once people were claiming there were too many Greeks and Italians).  I'll grant the Muslim issue may be a bit worse than normal since there seem to be certain incompatibilities between their religious beliefs and values and those of 'traditional' Christian/Humanist Australia, as well as a general sense of struggle between the West and Middle Eastern cultures which is stirring things up.  There also seems to be a greater (or just louder and more violent?) number of Muslim extremists for some reason, though I think they are still very few relative to the majority - Aljazeera and Sky news claim between 0.001% and 0.007% (respectively) of Muslims worldwide are responsible for the current trouble relating to that 'Innocence of Muslims' film.

Remember - the extremists want us to react.  They want us to crack down on Muslims generally and unfairly and thus make moderate Muslims radical.  They want to build hate.  Let's not play into that.

I really think it will all come out in the wash as time goes by, assuming we don't do anything silly like grant Shariah law any legal standing - where a real conflict of values and laws exists immigrants must  adapt to Australian values, culture and law, not Australia to migrants.

The question is, do we see these problems at all, or in sufficient quantity, to be alarmed in this regard? I think not!

1) Regular protest marches (eg weekly, fortnightly, monthly) organised by non-white ethnic groups and attended only by non-white ethnic groups in response to claims and accusations of systematic mistreatment.
2) Many such protest marches turning violent with attacks against the physical symbols of Australian democracy and society (the parliament, the courts, police stations, schools, etc, etc).
3) Frequent and systematic bashings and murders of one or more non-white ethnic groups by whites (or vice versa). 
4) Serious social problems endemic within non-white ethnic groups that are never or seldom experienced by white ethnic groups.

From my long-ago Sociological studies I recollect that most religions are considered to be a form of social glue that helps keep a society cohesive (which supports your idea) but that religion also props up the existing social order - including the lords and masters of the time (eg.  Kings with a divine mandate to rule, and various doctrinal and promised spiritual rewards for those that act in a way that society approves of, with punishments for those that don't).  This last aspect undermines part of your idea because the powers that be would not need 'subliminal social control' if they were supported by an appropriate religious structure, so individualism does not necessarily favour social control.

But I think you are close to the mark as to one of the causes of Western decline - I think it is less individualism as the root of the problem than it is a Balkanized (in this sense I mean fractious and non-unified) ideological and religious base in the West causing analysis/decision paralysis in Western decision making systems.  This is particularly obvious in the West’s recent tendency for the so called ‘left’ and ‘right’ to fight tooth and nail over everything.  It prevents us arriving at sensible middle-ground solutions (let alone conceding that the other side actually has the right pathway from time to time) and just generally leads to an inability to make choices in an efficient way.

This tendency to indecision and poor decisions gets even nastier when wedded to oligarchic manipulation and individual apathy!

Note – I mention ideologies because (at least at a social level) in many ways ideology is a close cousin to religion and can even be a substitute and rival for it, as the Soviets and other communists knew when they went on their anti-religion purges.

The primary term of reference for the panel was to consider the safety of life at sea and how best to mitigate the irregular maritime arrivals to Australia. That is simply what they have done. The whole premise of the report is to find effective pathways to “shift the balance of risk, predictability and incentive in favour of the use of regular pathways of international protection and migration, and against the need to resort to irregular and dangerous boat voyages to Australia” (Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, 2012: p37)
Essentially the report offers a mix of recommendations to dissuade perilous irregular maritime crossing to Australia with the view to expose asylum seekers to see in reality ‘that it is pointless to pay the costs and take the risks of a sea journey” (yourview.org, 2012: online) Furthermore the report is both humane and fair recommending an increase in the number of refugees into Australia in the magnitude of around 7000. (20,000 to 27,000).
Whilst the report differentiates between asylum seekers, refugees and displaced people the fact of the matter migration is a human phenomenon. Given our unique geographic charactistic of an island continent the pathways are limited to sea and air arrivals. By developing strategies such as the “no advantage” principle irregular maritime asylum seekers will become disincentived, thereby encouraging use of alternate pathways and eliminating the need to make risky sea voyages.
The report also introduces the area of sovereign rights and the overarching international conventions governing (perhaps guiding) refugee/asylum migration. On balance the needs of the nation and her capacity to support refugees needs to be considered as well.

In those circumstances, I think priests should be subject to Mandatory Reporting just like any other profession that deals extensively with children.
More urgent however is the removal of exemptions in things like the NSW Crimes Act dealing with concealing evidence of serious crimes. Priests most certainly not be exempt from such legislation, and any priest who has covered up evidence of child abuse should be fully prosecuted, Seal of the Confessional or no.

Age care industry is a typical example to prove how difficult to manage facilities for growing number of aging population. Currently age care industry is in short of staff because of this government diverting resources into age care to attract staff. Many other industries are in need of qualified staff due to this government constantly supplying lot of resources, not necessarily all resources producing expected outcome.

Let me preface my remarks then by saying that I am a refuge from the Catholic Church and that I regard the leadership of the Church in Australia, and in Rome, as making a powerful case for liberal humanism and the secular state. But allow me to play devil’s advocate for I think this issue has become so emotionally overcharged that the temptation is to see things as very simple. Children need protection. Terrible crimes have been committed against them. The State has a responsibility to act.
Some observations:
I.	The sanctity of the confessional is a classic moral dilemma that has been explored in fiction and film over hundreds of years.  My personal favourite is Hitchcock’s 1953 film ‘I Confess’, in which a priest hears a confession of murder, but is himself accused of the crime.  What is it about the issue of child sexual abuse that elevates it above other serious crimes and that would justify a change in the law with respect to confession that those other crimes apparently do not justify?

II.	Related to this is the rich tradition of anti-Catholic propaganda dating back to the Reformation. The trope of perverted priests, monks, and nuns abusing the confessional has titillated readers of Gothic fiction and anti-Catholic tracts for centuries.  George Pell’s public comments about the Royal Commission have been profoundly inadequate and offensive.  This is true beyond doubt. But his sense of being under attack is informed by the tradition of sectarian abuse in Australia. Pell has reason to fear prejudice and anti-Catholic hatred. I clearly remember the discrimination and abuse that Catholics copped from Protestants in country New South Wales during the 1970s. The fear of the Catholic hierarchy that sectarianism lies behind current inquiries into child abuse is therefore understandable.


III.	The utility of mandatory reporting is something worth considering. The intentions behind it are laudable, but does it on balance achieve its objectives?  I wonder if the mandatory reporting regime that has been in place for the last decade has been effective?  For one thing it presumes that the State is equipped to intervene and that such interventions will be to the benefit of the child. It’s worth pointing out then that one of the terrible ironies of the situation of many of the people who were abused as children was that they were wards of the State.  I wonder if the appeal of mandatory reporting to political parties has less to do with the welfare of children than with the political imperative to be seen to take harsh and decisive action.

IV.	Finally, how important is it that a law should be enforceable– is it enough that it affirms a principle?  Perhaps so.  But there are serious doubts in my mind that a) priests could be forced into reporting, and b) that anyone would be stupid enough to confess under circumstances where they did.  Bishop Geoffrey Robinson argued this point more eloquently than I could in an article in Eureka Street recently.
(http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=34262)

I have to agree with bkeniry though when he suggests that the Vatican need to direct priests that absolution from sin can only be granted in these cases when the penitent makes a confession to the secular authorities as well.

Whilst the popular press appears to be pushing an agenda of focusing on radical fringe elements of the Islamic communities in Australia it might well be time take a step back and consider the overwhelming successes of multiculturalism has brought to Australia for the benefit of all Australians. As Mungo MacCallum (ABC “The Drum”) puts it “multiculturalism may have its glitches” but these glitches should not be the catalyst to “panic and reverse policy”. In essence multiculturalism is a work in progress, continuing to develop, essentially in dynamic flux.

Supporting this view Frank Lowy In a recent lecture delivered to the Australian Multicultural Council puts forward multiculturalism is substantially a “triumph in tolerance” (ABC News). Lowy goes on to postulate that migrants should follow Australian values as “you are welcome; free to worship; you are free to honour your heritage; and we will respect to differences between us” adding that in return [migrants]”should agree to live by the standards and values of this society [Australia]the one you have chosen to be part of”. These views are congruent with the ideals of the National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia (Department of Immigration and Citizenship) identified as dimensions of cultural identity, social justice and economic efficiency.
 
By and large this has led to a successful integration of immigration, ergo multiculturalism, in Australia. The success of migration for the Snowy Mountain Scheme is well known. Other examples include the cultural precincts, rather than ‘enclaves’, of Melbourne and the Inner West of Sydney. These communities have influenced our culinary repertoire, design style and approach to community building at a social, cultural, environmental and economic level. In this context, the cultural precincts of Chinatown, Lonsdale Greek Precinct and Lygon Street are an embodiment of cosmopolitan lifestyle. They offer rich cultural diversity to the Australian society.

Even the Papal election within the closed walls of the enclave is shrouded in secrecy. And heaven help a theologian who dares to speak out on issues like female ordinance or artificial birth control. In following tradition then, the Church has gone out of its way to protect its own and give hush money to sexual abuse victims, this preventing potentially damaging public court cases. Like any public organisation, the Church will go to any lengths to protect its members and its image - the difference is, it claims the moral high ground, has political clout and pays no taxes.

Or ""the legitimacy of an action concerns the harm caused by the action.""  Or the Golden Rule or whatever else is proposed.

I guess what I'm trying to say, poorly, is that Acts of Parliament (and Regulations of statutory bodies etc.) are very specific rules that we apparently can, and perhaps must, disobey when they're ""unjust.""  But ""justice"" (or what is ""right"" or ""good"" or ""moral"") is then defined by a broader set of ""rules"" that are essentially those that scholars come up with as possible solutions to the problem of political obligation.  But why are these rules any more binding than the rules one ""rung"" down?  They weren't voted on.  And even if they're very popular, and they did come up for vote, that would make these principles no different from popular Acts of Parliament (popularity and power to enforce don't make things ""right"")  Someone could say that justice is ""me gaining at everyone else's expense"" and we could call them inconsistent, or unproductive, or whatever else, but the only thing that makes them ""wrong"" is that they possess a belief that is unpopular and one that most citizens would use violence to prevent being exercised.

Those who are benefiting from coal mining show no interest in taking responsibility for the long-term damage of their activities, and NSW's elected representatives appear focussed on short-term revenue generation.
NSW government announced on the eve of Christmas that was removing funding for the legitimate means of protest, legal aid and the Environmental Defenders Office. This leaves environmental and inter-generational protectors with few options to challenge the might of the miners.
With that background, Moylan's hoax lasted 20 minutes, the share price dropped for that period alone, to December levels and it is estimated from share sales data that approximately $500,000 was ‘lost’ by sellers (and of course gained by buyers).

Huge amounts of money can be saved in the court system and police work through legalisation (of course it must be coupled with regulation and taxation). Therefore, even if there was a marginal increase in drug usage (unlikely), there are major benefits of legalisation in the long-term as more money can be spent on education and harm minimisation. Politicians don't care about the long-term. All of Jo Baxter's arguments are nonsense - You can't just first assume drug use will increase then bring child abuse into the argument - such a catch call for opposers. Children are abused now because funds are spent making the drugs illegal and hence less is being done to help the small minority who have a real problem. The solution is right before our eyes - legalise, regulate, educate (less children with addicted parents who are not being helped, huge reductions in trafficking and illegal manufacture since people will choose legal product, again reducing child exposure).",,"",,"",,"",,"",,"",

North Korea’s area of “muddling through” appears to be over under the leadership of Kim Jong Un.  Rightly or wrongly, his government has noticeably quickened the pace of decisive policy decision-making in pursuit of a simultaneous nuclear security and economic development program.  

Here one needs to understand the unique logic of North Korean foreign policy.  To this end, Pyongyang sees hard military power as the only reliable means of guaranteeing its security in what it perceives as a hostile strategic environment.  North Korea’s foreign policy behaviour generally exhibits ultra-realist tendencies based on Songun (military-first) politics, emphasising the utility of military force as its only credible security guarantee in what it perceives to be a strategically hostile environment.  Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capabilities are the ultimate practical expressions of this world-view.

The regime also maintains an explicitly stated objective of transforming North Korea into a “strong and prosperous country” through a program of economic development.  This development program may include moves toward the implementation of incremental economic restructuring.  I am loathe to use the word “reform” because this term is loaded with the ideological baggage of the narrow neoliberal style of economic transition favoured by many foreign observers.  Whether neoliberal reform is desirable for North Korea or not is beside the point, as it does not encapsulate the transformations that are beginning to take shape within the DPRK.

The nuclear security umbrella, however, is not quite ready.  North Korea’s ability to strike targets in South Korea artillery and short-medium range missiles is well documented and has been a key plank of its strategic posture for decades.  They are certainly capable of striking targets in South Korea and Japan.  Less plausible is the North’s ability to hit targets further afield with long-range nuclear-armed missiles, the successful December 2012 rocket launch and nuclear test on February 12 this year notwithstanding.  One successful long-range missile test does not prove that Pyongyang is ready to deploy reliable, accurate long-range missiles in the field.  Likewise, the February nuclear test has not proven definitively that North Korean scientists have engineered a weaponised nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile, despite clear advances in miniaturisation evidenced by the test.

Since 1990, Australia’s domestic and industrial greenhouse emissions have increased, on balance, by some 4.2%.
Its underlying emissions have increased by 28.8%.
Most of this change is associated with the unchecked development of coal-fired and gas-fired power stations to produce electricity (+47% in emissions since 1990) and increased transport use (+27%).
It is only because emissions from land clearing have been halved ... that Australia has managed to offset this underlying increase and approach its Kyoto Protocol-determined target of 108% above 1990 levels.

As a result, Australia has the world’s highest level of emissions per person ...

It's become an absolute joke. The city is already over crowded, on a day that we consider to be 'dead', is hardly the case in the city during the day.

But all we are really doing is reimbursing the government for their countless financial incompetencies and prolonging the time of earth's extinction. No joke. 

However, we are pushing the boundaries up to what each household must pay. I think it should apply to different wages, different financial capabilities and family capacities corresponding with your assets. This is so that those who are financially stable and own a substantial amount of assets, should be paying an amount that corresponds with what they own, likewise with a less wealthier family. 

It's only fair for those who cannot afford the increase in cost of living. Australia DOES have poverty. We do not exclude ourselves from this problem. The more we endure with this carbon tax... poverty, employment, bankruptcy will incline. Our economy will fail. 

The carbon tax is a retaliation and a quick problem to fix the gaps in the government's budget and solver for climate change. By extracting more money out of people to fix all these problems, is a stupid and materialistic resolution.

—	preventing excessive media ownership concentration, and

—	effective enforcement of journalistic standards including a meaningful right of reply.

However, media concentration in Australia has already crossed the threshold beyond which it is politically suicidal for any government to attempt serious reform in either area.
The recent failure of the government's attempt to limit *further* loss of media diversity by enhancing self-regulation (via the Public Interest Media Advocate) is a demonstration of this.
It was only the the deplorable conduct of the *News of the World* that gave politicians in the UK a brief (and limited) window of opportunity to intervene.

We are witnessing the exercise of monopoly power in the information marketplace.
And media power translates into political power.

Political power is necessary to resist excessive media concentration.
However, once such a concentration exists, the political power necessary to reduce it is no longer available.

Tony Abbott, more than anyone, understands this:

[Thanks to] Gina Rinehart, who has given what I’m sure is the best speech that any one will give tonight ...

Along with [Howard Florey] the co-inventor of penicillin [who] literally saved millions of lives, Rupert Murdoch is probably the Australian who has most shaped the world ...
For our guest of honour ... experience trumps theory and facts trump speculation.
His publications have borne his ideals but never his fingerprints.
Rupert Murdoch is a corporate citizen of many countries, but above all else, he’s one of us.

You could even use this kind of technology for cross-institutional teaching, where a lecture given at one university can be streamed live, with the opportunity for students to ask questions and so on, to another university anywhere in the country (or even the world)

First up, let's assume, for the sake of debate, that it IS ""inevitable"" that gay marriage will be approved. Why does that make this a good thing?

Secondly, if the change truly is ""inevitable"", why lift a finger? It's going to happen anyway, isn't it? One only has to state the matter in these terms to see that the argument refutes itself.

That is the only reason why marriage contracts and vows make sense. Otherwise, a no contract or civil union arrangement and libertarian individualism would surely suffice.

What would be the reason for privatising? To raise some money by selling public assets? That only leads to the public having to rent those assets back. Why sell something only to rent it back from the new owners. Makes no sense. 

Because you don't like the way they do journalism? What, because it doesn't suit your corporate interests. Hmm, you want to buy it so you can better control it? That is not in Australia's interests.

So you would sell it, so that it runs more efficiently? Really? I think what you mean is you would be able to cheapen the journalistic processes. But it is the act of journalism practices well that gives democracy its foundation, so that is not a good idea.

Oh, you want to sell it so that the user pays more directly, less indirectly? But if the benefits of strong journalism is a strong democracy and protection of the public interest, then it is only right that the costs are borne by taxes, in fact there is no better or efficient funding model. All other models generate higher administration costs.

No, this notion has got to be killed off. Its just a bad idea.

The glib answer to ""why stop the boats"" is to prevent deaths at sea caused by the criminal gangs of people smugglers. If today any political party said that they could prevent deaths from drug overdose by throwing the addicts in jail, we would laugh at them! Isn't this the same?

People smugglers are a fact of life as are drug pushers. If I was in the situation of the asylum seekers and I had the money I would step onto a leaky boat, rather than waiting 40 or 50 years in Indonesia or Malaysia. I know that I am unwanted there and also know full well that I may drown! 

There are 14 Million Refugees in our region and acceptance of 28,000 from the camps represents only 0.2 % per year. This is not going to stop the boats. On the other hand the boat arrivals will be limited by the required required $ 10K - 12K and perhaps fear of drowning.

Economically offshore processing makes no sense either. According to Julian Burnside's article ""You have been misled on boat people..."" we are spending up to $450,000 per person per year for off shore processing and detention. That is $8,600 per week and few of us get that sort of money!

We could process the asylum seekers arriving on shore to determine their status, from past results a majority would be genuine refugees.
These should be accepted with two conditions -

1. They should NOT have the right of family re-union for obvious reasons.
2. For a period of 2 - 3 years they should be placed into communities at the government's discretion ie. not allowed to go to Western Sydney. This was so for government assisted migrants during the 1940's and 1950's.

There is no doubt that cutting spending would damage Australia's economy. Although it is always a good idea to take the power of spending away from the state, the monetary system we currently use would not allow it. Despite the fact that the RBA is owned by COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA (I mean the corporation, not the constitutional entity, if that isn't clear), the debt owed to the RBA by taxpayers can never be repaid. As a simple example, if I were the only person in the economy, and borrowed one thousand dollars from the RBA (I cannot, as the RBA only deals with the government and banks, but for simplicity we'll continue), at even a modest 1% per annum, then I would owe, principle plus interest, one thousand and ten dollars at the end of the year. Where would I find the ten dollars? 

Of course I would have to borrow it, at 1% interest. No matter how many people are place into this system, the interest can never be repaid, as it is never in the system to start with. Individuals may be able to leverage themselves against others and pay back their personal liability, but the total amount of interest owed must be borrowed again at some point. Default is the only mechanism for reducing this mechanism even a little. Do you feel like a rat in a barrel?

So this question, either ignorantly or disingenuously, is the wrong one. A much better question would have been: Should the Commonwealth Bank Act of 1945 be repealed, allowing private currencies to compete within the Australian economy? Hell yes.

Two further notes. Firstly, should a triple A rating be trusted? Do you know who determines the rating, and what agenda they have?

What many people forget, or perhaps never knew to start with, is that science is a dynamic system for disproving hypothesis and theory. It's very nature precludes the certainty of proof. To reiterate the point, the system of science cannot, and never will be able to, prove anything. We become incrementally more certain of a theory as more experiments are devised and conducted to test it, and it is NOT disproved by a failure.

Propaganda and science should never ever be entertained in each other's company. The very nature of public education reduces the ability of scientists to remain objective when performing their function.

The waters are far too muddied for anyone, and I mean anyone, to even begin to decipher. From hypothetical computer models with little correlation to the physical phenomena, tightly coupled because of the collaboration and required reading, where a shifting of a single unknowable variable can change the results drastically. 

We simply haven't been watching long enough to know what the hell we are talking about.

If you don't know it's broken, don't try to fix it. And for the love of man and science, please stop polluting science with this toxic idea of certainty.  

We have expended energy applying this legislation when the truth is, we don't even know what the effects of more carbon in the atmosphere are. It could be positive, it could be negative. It is NOT known. We don't know how much is coming from direct human activity, or how much is coming from desertification, animal life on land and in the sea, geological phenomena, retreating ice.

I'm not sure if links are allowed, but I'll conclude with a link to a TED talk that coincidentally highlights the problem with thinking you know something for certain. And how destructive absolute trust in science as an engine for political certainty can be.

How are you going to be an agent for the better treatment of animals if you are not there, if you are not showing the way, if you are not giving training programs and leading the industry? You can't. So if you truly do care, pulling back from such countries is not the way. Pushing into them is the way. 

This public debate has been hijacked by the animal welfarists. But the persons who understand cattle, those who work with cattle all the time, those who every day tend to the health and well-being needs of cattle, these people are called farmers and they know their business. They know the practicalities of caring. They suffer for their animals welfare with far greater insight than the well-meaning desk bound folk in the cities, who suffer big vets bills for their domestic pets. Its is the farmers who deserve to lead this debate. And if you do the research and listen to what they say, they say we do care, we do work with the supply lines and we are making a difference to how animals are treated all around the world. 

Yes you can shut down live trade, but no, it is not a step that will lead to improved animal welfare overseas. If that is your goal, then closing live export is a backwards step.

The assumption here is that this is viable for export.

An abattoir's profit and loss statement is driven by the need to keep throughput steady. Wages costs are a large part of the costs, as well as energy costs for all that cooler and chiller space. So there is very little margin in Australia abattoir operations. Because they operate as a small number of providers to a larger numbers of farmers, farmers can play one against the other and this keeps profitability at a slim level. If you study the number of abattoir closures, restructures and reopenings it will drive home the point to you that the abattoir business is a tough  business to survive

This slim profit is what you can make selling into the Australian market. 

When you turn around and sell product into an overseas market, you must pay Australian wages for the value adding (slaughtering and butchering and packing and freezing) but you must obtain your whole sale price in an economy that has no linkage to the Australian domestic meat price. Quite likely you won't get the price you need. 

Setting up frozen meat export is far more tricky than the bald statement of this policy would have us assume. There are examples where it has worked in Australia, such as where a abattoir operator is able to corner the supply lines and maintain control over the supply channel into the market. It has been done, but its not easy. Those advocating this policy probably know its very hard, and between the lines the real aim is to shut down meat production. We should not support a policy that aims at a concealed goal.

The problem is your conclusion ""when in doubt, do nothing""
Actually, when in doubt, the best thing to do is to perform a risk analysis. This essentially involves determining how bad (or good) the consequences of certain outcomes will be, and also how likely those outcomes are. Climate change is a perfect example of a topic that requires risk analysis because, when one performs a risk analysis, even an outcome that is relatively unlikely must be taken seriously if that outcome is going to be sufficiently bad (as seems to be the case with even many of the more modest climate predictions)
Essentially, in circumstances like this, risk analysis tells us to apply the precautionary principle (rather than you ""when in doubt, do nothing""). If something really bad MIGHT happen, do something to reduce the likelihood of its happening or to mitigate how bad it will be if it does happen.

Not that long ago, it was all about family and trade alliances. Women had no say in it and were treated like property to be bartered for cattle and sold off when they were born.  The modern idea of marriage is very different and is centered around love, respect and commitment. 

The arguements on the the 'against' side make no sense in the modern day.

Marriage is not about having children  - I know plenty of hetero married couples who do not want children.

It would be pretty easy to have a 'morally tenable' definition of marriage:  Love, respect, and commitment between two people.  It's really not that hard. And a lot of hetero married couples do seem to miss a few of those points. The rest of this is just a 'slippery slope' fallacious argument.

There many ""traditional"" definitions of marriage - which one should be considered sacrosanct? Several around the world considered that a man could have many wives as long as he could support them all. Others have considered that it was perfectly normal to sleep with ones in-laws. Again, many have considered woman to be nothing more than property. Just in the last century the definition of marriage in the USA prohibited inter-racial marriage. 

Marriage is not about the church or religion - if it was, then only christians would be able to marry. There would be no civil ceremonies, there would be no marriage between people of different religions, there would be no history of marriage from before modern religion.

It probably would help those local economies in terms of employment and trade. If adequate funding was provided for this from our aid/refugee budget I cannot see why countries concerned would not agree. Furthermore, we could have a penalty of reduced funding for every boat that came to our shores after that - that would encourage the transit countries to put in more effort to stop the people smuggling themselves.

I don't understand how people can say otherwise. 
Does sexuality define a person? Does it matter who we love? 

Society needs to grow up, how don't same sex couples constitute real families? Because they have the same genital and can't reproduce? Honestly who cares, science is growing and same-sex couples can in fact have children. Some straight people can't have children, so why can they get married? because they're genitalia are different?  

As individuals we love who we love, and we cannot help it. People do not choose to be gay, and it shouldn't be frowned upon - people should embrace who they are and who they love and not be so scared to be in public showing affection to the person they love; It is honestly disgusting that people have the right to say if two people love each other they cannot get married because they are gay or lesbian. 

And for those people who oppose to it because of religious reasons, well the bible says not to judge people and to accept individuals for who we are, we are all Gods children and he loves us etc etc...

When I was younger I observed that a teacher could make me love a subject only from his character and knowledge about the subject. Also the way that he expressed his ideas in the course made a bug difference on the way I understood each topic. By taking a look what the aspects of the Better Schools program, I saw that it focuses on 3 key functions that a teacher must have. Those are the ones of general knowledge, practical experience, and motivation of a teacher.

Balanced teachers with general knowledge that does not necessarily focuses on their field are better in teaching. The better schools program focuses on providing teachers both with math and literacy skills that can be used on the classroom. Recalling a teacher I had in chemistry classes back in high school I must say that it confused me when he skipped the problems that had to do with mathematics, so a teacher that can use a wide range of skills can actually be a better teacher.

Another aspect is that of practical experience that make the teacher more comfortable in a teaching environment. The 2 years of practice that the program offers can actually help to provide teachers with wisdom on teaching and make them more transmissible.

Last, and most important is the admission process that is related with passion and motivation on the better schools program. Like doctors, teachers most be passionate about their job, which is actually a job to provide the individual with psychological ""payment"" and monetary at the least. Through this program which is actually very accurate since it consists of interviews and tests, teachers that love to educate others will be more productive in the environment of education.

Education if a very important value in our lives and those that provide it have to be the best. Education builds our future and provides knowledge to the future generations. Without it we might end up in vary unwanted paths, that's why i choose to vote for this program that will eventually support better education.  ",,"",,"",,"",,"",5,"",5

And even with seven years of university and a Masters degree, getting employed as a teacher is *incredibly* hard.
Also, suggesting that the ATAR for teaching degrees is too low is problematic in itself.

If we look back to the Howard's school funding model, it is hard to blink at the fact how public schools were being damaged. And currently if we look at coalitions different policy agenda: company tax cut, the earning limit of paid parental leave and so on, it clear though in some cases they are trying to catch up labour to ensure the betterment of the poor, but under different pretext maximum benifits are going to those who literally do not need.

The most important ground is it keeps the teacher busy with test materials, hence is a hindrance of kids' effective learning and development. It's true the methods and ultimate outcomes of education can be argued in many ways. Without going to this vast issue, I would like to simply ask if there is no problem for our children to participate in different international tests, why is it so harmful for them when the take part in national testing with much less depth and competitive? Putting pressure off the students is necessary, but it does not mean that students should not sit for the test and they should not be competitive. To make the kids more competitive in a positive wayIis the greatest challenge for our teachers and of our education system.

These people have been caught up in a conflict that we actually said was worth committing troops to. I know for a fact that many of these people have left because what they face is certain death, in particular the Hazara from Afghanistan. By playing politics and preaching a doctrine of misinformation and hate we have created a nation that no longer accepts that people should be treated humanely. There are better ways to spend the 3.7 billion currently spent on asylum seekers.
I get to see the end result of a person held in detention, the mental and physical anguish, the struggle for recognition and the mistreatment and vilification within the larger Australian community due to the electioneering and desperate grab for votes at any cost. When you turn back boats you turn back lives. These are people who would have preferred to stay in there own country but genuinely seek asylum as their lives are dangerous and unlivable.
Those that make a life here inspire me with their willingness to work hard and their heartfelt want to embrace our country.
i consider that a month is long enough to process their documents and to conduct health checks, then after that they should be helped to integrate into mainstream society. They are not jumping queues and this idea is simply aberrant nonsense as they have no concept of this at all. They are fleeing certain death and they leave because they are no choices left to make.
My commitment to them is to encourage them to learn English, educate them in the ways of Australian politics and to promote their path to a better life. I offer them empowerment and I embrace their differences and what I get is a person who is finally in control of their life and is now  ready to embark upon a happier and more self fulfilling life. 
Whenever I hear someone talk about off shore processing, turning back boats and having zero tolerance I can always be assured they are doing so out of ignorance and fear.

1. Yes, you might think he's had a poor track record. But that would be to deny the work of Rudd's first ministry such as the Economic Stimulus Packages, SafeWork Australia, FairWork Australia, The Apology, Ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, the Education Revolution, The Emissions Trading Scheme proposal (vehemently opposed by the opposition, led to the sacking of their most competent leader in years by one vote AND led to the implementation of a highly criticised carbon tax) to mention a few.

2. He may have not been liked within his own party, however they were still functional. Already we've seen a change in his behaviour with the party, his team seems even more together now than it ever was. Minister Tony Burke said earlier today that he had a strong professional relationship with Rudd - despite his strong support of Gillard throughout her ministry and in the leadership change. 

3. He's tried and tested in international relations, being incredibly well versed in foreign affairs. Abbott has little to no experience in this level of diplomacy. It'd be unfair to judge him on this since there's no precedent, but his often tactless nature would certainly be an impediment. 

I could go on, but I'd hate for this to become an argument ad hominem. Both are intelligent and capable men, but Rudd and his team have a plan and a path of investment in the future - that those in a generation will benefit from.

The implementation of the Gillard government's carbon tax was also another shortcoming. It discouraged companies from capturing 100% of emissions and the reimbursements made it nearly unprofitable. On top of that, some companies used it to increase pricing on goods that weren't even effected by the price (some under the review of the ACCC) and has been used as a scapegoat by electricity companies for the large costs - despite these costs actually being attributed to infrastructure upgrades.

1. The Indonesian Ambassador has stated that he doesn't agree with the policy of turning back the boats. It places a burden on the already overpopulated nation - and it'a clear abrogation of Australia's responsibility as a UNHCR signatory. 
2. Just that point exactly - we are a signatory of the Refugee Convention and it is our international obligation to help all those seeking asylum. 
3. The argument that 'some of them are economic migrants' doesn't cut it. How can we make that judgement on the high seas? The answer is that we can't - it's just a convenient excuse to turn the boats around. 
4. Economic refugees, those fleeing their nation because of their inability to achieve equality, the lack of equal opportunity, impoverishment etc. should still be considered as legitimate refugees.

Tony Abbott can cry 'stop the boats' all he wants, but the problem still exists, and unless the problem is resolved, this injustice would continue.

In the case of the Migration Act, acting unlawfully is a condition precedent to the granting of asylum - at least, for those arriving without a visa.

I think it would be helpful for those opposed to the terminology of 'unlawfulness' to acknowledge this, including the some lawyers doing the rounds.  I understand that they want to avoid the negative connotations associated with the word ""unlawful"" but you don't do that by saying that because something is not a crime it is therefore not unlawful.  Which politician or senior commentator claimed it was a criminal offence? Sure, some people equate the two, and perhaps that leads to ignorant people making ignorant statements on talkback radio, but you don't combat that by making legally unsound rebuttals.

MIGRATION ACT 1958 - SECT 228B
Circumstances in which a non-citizen has no lawful right to come to Australia
(1)  For the purposes of this Subdivision, a non-citizen has, at a particular time, no lawful right to come to Australia if, at that time:
(a)  the non-citizen does not hold a visa that is in effect; and
(b)  the non-citizen is not covered by an exception referred to in subsection 42(2) or (2A); and
(c)  the non-citizen is not permitted by regulations under subsection 42(3) to travel to Australia without a visa that is in effect.
(2)  To avoid doubt, a reference in subsection (1) to a non-citizen includes a reference to a non-citizen seeking protection or asylum (however described), whether or not Australia has, or may have, protection obligations in respect of the non-citizen:
(a)  under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol; or
(b)  for any other reason.

11. Carbon tax - yes, obviously debatable but in terms of competent policy, this was the first move towards seriously taking action on reducing carbon emissions, to meet international targets and to ensure the largest polluters complied. It did reduce emissions and electricity production - unfortunately it was used as a scapegoat by companies to pass off high prices onto consumers, as well as the LNP to delegitimise the ALP and Greens. Rudd's move towards a floating price and an effective ETS (although not implemented) is a further step forward for reducing carbon emissions. 
12. The mining tax - obvious problems concerning mining companies actually paying this tax, and there have definitely been issues with implementation and the scope of the tax - however it's a competent and potential revenue raiser.
13. Paid parental leave - providing a standard and consistent safety net for all families.
14. The promise to put legislation regarding same sex marriage in front of before the parliament within 100 days (if re-elected). 

The list goes on. To say the government has been incompetent would be to reject all these fantastic achievements. Sure, there were missed opportunities, sure there were rushed policies, perhaps the carbon tax could have better thought out, the mining tax could have had a broader scope and better integration with the current royalty system in states - however for all the instability, for all the complaints of the minority government, progress was achieved. 

Should the Liberals be elected, could they offer the same progressive change? Or should we expect a stagnation of economic growth, spending cuts where funding is needed, spending where it's unnecessary, ineffective ETS and a rushed surplus.

What SHOULD be seen as illegal, or unlawful or however you want to put it is the government's proposal to penalise asylum seekers who come here by boat by sending them to under-funded, poorly maintained detention centres in the Pacific (where their fates then lie in the hands of the PNG government) and offer them no prospect of getting Australian citizenship. 

It's a clear abrogation of Australia's obligation and responsibility as a signatory of the United Nation's Refugee Convention - and although UN agreements are not binding law's of the land, that doesn't mean we shouldn't commit ourselves to them when we're finding it a little difficult to come to a decision on how to process those seeking asylum. 

Politicians are shifting out problem onto nations themselves that can't solve it, PNG has stated that those sent to detention may be settled in a third nation - can their safety be guaranteed there? Under Abbott's scheme, they'd have to make their way to Indonesia - an overpopulated nation with an already poor standard of living.

I think the ability to compare schools based on performance is not only a fantastic resource for parents, but a fantastic resource for schools - literacy and numeracy rankings will highlight which areas of study schools need to improve in and will overall enhance the direction the schools take.

However, on that note I agree that NAPLAN is probably not the best representation of a student's performance, or progress and improvement. Not all children will be geared to academic subjects - the way NAPLAN essentially operates - and thus it's true that if their performance is lacking, it misrepresents not only that child's achievements and potential, but the school too. 

Parents should be looking out for schools which record the greatest improvement, not necessarily the highest overall rankings.

But, whether people want to admit it or not, unemployment and underemployment is on the rise. Most unemployed and underemployed people I know don't choose to be on the dole and would much prefer to be working for a sustainable wage. But lately for many of us it just doesn't happen. We get a bit of work here and there, sometimes it isn't worth it after we take out travel expenses too and from the job and such. The dole is not enough to live on. With the cost of essential services forever on the rise it doesn't even pay for the basics now. I understand that people see many unemployed as bogan dole bludgers, and I have no idea how people can afford to smoke and buy drugs and alcohol on the dole. I certainly can't afford those things. But remember, people who don't look for jobs don't get payed. We are all kept under the very watchful eyes of Job Service Providers. If we miss out 'Job Shops' or out meetings our payments can be cancelled. 
If you oppose raising Newstart payments to something more livable because you think people choose to be unemployed, just think about your contribution to unemployment when you go through a self serve checkout or sign up to a service that outsources to  a foreign company. And business owners if you oppose the increase then think about how much you cost taxpayers if you get Government funding to hire someone for a certain amount of time.

It doesn't really do much.  All it says is that an asylum seeker without a visa has no *right* to enter Australia.  But that's fairly meaningless.

I have no right to a cheese sandwich.  But having no right to one does not mean I can't have one.  A 'right' is typically a positive law.  Removing that positive (as this section of the Act does) does not, however, leave a negative, rather it leaves things neutral. 

In contrast, everyday laws are negative laws eg. ""You shall not do X"".  Indeed, one of the fundamental pillars of Australian law is that, for private individuals at least (citizens or not), you are allowed to do absolutely *anything* you want unless there is a law specifically prohibiting it.  ""There is no law against eating a human that is already dead"" - anyone else see that episode of Rake?

Section 228B creates no law against coming to Australia as a refugee without a visa.

In my view the entire purpose of 228B is simply to hobble judges from reading a guaranteed right of entry in from Article 31 of the Refugee Convention (the giveaway is the phrase ""to avoid doubt..."").  Article 31, incidentally, is a complete dog's breakfast that has a very confused concept of what 'illegal' actually means - it contradicts itself quite openly.  Section 228B probably only exists to deliberately maintain that ambiguity so that governments can keep calling refugees 'illegal entrants' when they should more correctly be called 'unauthorized entrants'.

So that's 228B.  The real problem is more to do with s 14 of the Migration Act, which calls any non-citizen in the migration zone without a visa ""unlawful"", without actually imposing any penalties or remedies.  Indeed it *can't* impose any penalties, because that would be in clear violation of the Refugee Convention.

That makes this argument all boil down to this:

Is a law without penalties or remedies even a law?   

I doubt it.  It's hard to find a definition of law that doesn't involve some concept of enforcement.  Otherwise it's just description with no force of law.   At best, it's 'Claytons' law.  

Ideally, the Act should be rewritten to more correctly use the term ""unauthorized"" rather than ""unlawful"".   Otherwise you're just left with...

A good friend of mine, originally from Nepal, now lives in this country and loves it.  Nevertheless, she has a few criticisms about our culture, most of which I entirely agree with.  She is unhappy with our focus on rampant consumerism.  She thinks we don't value our families enough.  She can be quite passionate about it, occasionally arguing to the extent where I think she is going in a little too hard about how Australia could learn a few things, and I'm slightly offended.

If she were to say those things on Yourview (i.e. a public forum) then she would pretty much satisfy the elements of the offence, and be guilty under s 18C of a contravention of the Racial Discrimination Act.

That is a ridiculous outcome.

Furthermore, when she in full flight, I occasionally get defensive and feel the need to counter that while Nepal is a great country, it's culture isn't perfect either.  The treatment of women is fairly appalling there, which is one of the reasons she came to Australia in the first place.

Now I just *did* say that in a public forum, and there may be some Nepalis out there who are offended that I am attacking their culture.  

Guards, seize them both!!!

The trouble with s 18C is that there *is* such a thing as valid cultural criticism.  No culture is perfect, and we shouldn't carry on as if they are. If, for example, a culture advocates genocide against another group,  or advocates child labour, then I know plenty of people who have a problem with that.  Those people are not racists, and should not be held in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act for denouncing those acts.

Section 18C is in the right spirit, but it just hasn't been thought through far enough.  Let me be clear: it is *never* ok to discriminate against somebody on the basis of genetic difference.  It is *never* ok to hassle somebody over cultural or ethnic beliefs when the intention is merely to ""offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate"".   But s 18C doesn't say that.  All it says that you're busted if it's *likely* someone took offense, regardless of your intention or the merits of your argument.

There're more desperate people in the refugees camps than those who can afford to come by boats through paying people smugglers a fortune. By so doing, they take advantage of others who cannot afford to do so and thus take away the place of resettlement belonging to those waiting in the queue patiently (more than a decade in some cases) and suffering in silence with no human rights advocate speaking up for them globally and here in Australia. Some of these people jumping the queue have been found out that they are people smugglers themselves. On top of that, there are potential criminals and terrorists in their midst we don't really know for certainty and it is not easy to check out their pasts thoroughly. Where did they get the money to pay people smugglers in the first place to bring them from a far distance until they could travel by boat? If they could pay $5000 or $7000 per head to jump on boat, they are better off than 100,000+ homeless people here in Australia! Which group is more desperately in need of our support than the other then?  We don't know the money they have is ill-gotten gains or not. If they could pay that much, they should have used them to lodge their applications formally via officially recognized channels like everyone else doing so via Australian Migration Program. Australia is not a country asylum seekers can buy their way to through people smugglers. This is the crust of the matter: to deter people from thinking that they can use illegal methods and evil people to get what they want without facing justice ie the consequences of their choice.
Their illegal coming costs taxpayer a fortune; budget blowout more than 10 billion in 6 year’s time according to the news reports; they have disrupted the orderly queue for migration; they pose potential danger and harm to the communities which are not easily to be assessed correctly and quickly and that is why they are locked up in detention centres (Of course they are not like homes but are necessary).
If they have made that choice for themselves, they have to bear the consequences of that choice they make, including the prospects of losing their life at sea, losing their loved ones on their way to Australia, and losing their freedom and privacy in detention centres. They ought to weigh up their options and costs and pay the price for it.  This is why other asylum seekers do not follow their folly but register with UNHCR so that their cases would be heard in due time whist they don’t have to put the life of their family members at risk.  The Australian government should have helped UNHCR to main the queue orderly and give everyone seeking refugee status a fair go. Money should be injected to upgrade UNHCR refugee camps and the living conditions of those waiting in the queue.
After all, everyone comes to Australia must wait in the queue to obtain legally acceptable visa; no excuse is acceptable because it does injustice to others who do the right thing, regardless of the category visa they seek to apply for. Orphans in camps should come first! Those willing to adapt readily to the way of life, the values and law and order here in Australia should be considered more favourably than those believe in Jihad, waging wars against Christians and those opposing them, and seek to bring in Islamic control here in Australia like those who came before earlier, living life consecrated to the cause of Allah like their fellowmen have done in their homeland, especially true by records of those coming from the Middle East and North Africa.  This is why their countries are torn apart, leaving behind displaced people who need to seek refuge in other countries.
Australia is at high risk of bring in danger and harm she cannot see clearly and completely just now through her migration program and that is why the government has to be tough and yet fair on those who do the wrong thing and send a clear message to all that Australian government would not reward those who suffer for their wrong choices they make for themselves in the process of seeking a better life or resettlement.
Moreover, we don't need more people coming to build divisive communities here but to build a united Australia under one law and one culture based upon Australian heritage of the past. Remember your root and origin; remember how Australia was built in the first place. Remember how the true and living God blesses the land daily, weekly, and yearly, and how she has become a blessing to many nations until today.
We welcome genuine refugees in need who do the right thing by complying with Australian government policies, procedures and standards of assessment to be resettled in our midst and have their life and health restored in due time but not those who jump the queue, use people smugglers to get what they want quickly at the expense of others, who have secret agenda to do evil here, weakening our foundations of success in Australia.",,"",,"",,"",,"",4,"",4

years.
If they were allowed to work, there would be more incentives for others to follow their footsteps, giving people smugglers another selling point for their business.

This comes from the book of Genesis when God created man and woman (Adam and Eve) and brought them together in marital union and thus became the first parents of all generations to come. Down through the ages, there have been   sexual perversions happening in every corner of globe, including in the days of Noah and the days of Lot and Abraham. The most holy God sees everything clearly and correctly since He is the maker of man and woman and has the final say over all life, and therefore God sees homosexuality as a form of sexual perversion and condemns it as abomination. This can cause offence to people seeking to oppose God and His perfect view of sex and sexual union. 
We do fear God and accept His view as the best for mankind and seek to protect marriage as it has been so between a man and a woman. (Bible reference: Gen19; Romans1:26-27; Jude1:7)
We do not condemn homosexual partnership because we are not God who judges all in due time; we do however oppose anyone trying to undermine what marriage is really all about according to God's standards of definition and purpose.
Just as Sodom and Gomorrah were burned to ashes in the past because of sexual perversion practices, so there will be days of punishment for those who reject God's warnings and persist in their own ways when they face judgement of God in due time.
The Bible plainly states in the New Testament, in Jude 1:7...

""Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange (Greek: different, other) flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.""

""For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.""

The context of Jude 1:7 clearly implies homosexuality.  ""Going after strange flesh"" means going after flesh ""different"" than what is rightfully ours to claim (our spouse's body -1st Corinthians 7:4).  Notice that Jude mentions both ""fornication"" and ""going after strange flesh."" 

Obviously, Sodom's sins were more than fornication, and certainly more than a ""lack of hospitality.""  The ""strange"" flesh simply refers to that which is forbidden by God for us to have, it is flesh outside the bounds of God's laws; hence, the term ""sexual deviance"" (to deviate from what is acceptable to God).

In the simplest of terms because in depth explanation here is not feasible, scientists estimate “that 15 gigatons (15 billion tons) of CO2 emissions will increase atmospheric CO2 by 1.0 part per million, that for every 50 parts per million of increased atmospheric CO2 there will be a 1.0 degree increase in global average temperature, and that a ton of CO2 emissions can be avoided via an expense of $25 – i.e., for 25 billion dollars, we can avoid emitting one gigaton of CO2. And using these assumptions, it would cost $19 trillion to lower the projected temperature of the planet by 1.0 degree centigrade at the rate of $2714 per world capita.


Hence only by the world acting in concert can we reduce the rate of climate change (315 ppm to 400 ppm between 1955- 2013). Thus world CO2 levels increased by 1.275 trillion tons during the last 58 years, mainly through burning coal and other fossil fuels. The cost of repeating this use of fossil fuels is about $32.3 trillion. Therein lays the economic gross stupidity of using fossil fuels.

Marriage SYMBOLISES an inherently reproductive. Of course there has been childless marriages since the year dot, but the critical point is that a childless marriage does NOT detract from the symbolism of marriage. Whereas, on the other hand, a same-sex ""marriage"" DOES, because a same-sex ""marriage"" isn't about an inherently reproductive relationship; rather it's about the never-ending quest of the militant Gay lobby to publicly validate homosexuality, and impose its values on conservatives and traditionalists.",,"",,"",,"",,"",1,"",1

Homosexuals already enjoy equality from the law, due to reforms passed by the Gillard government a few years ago. They enjoy such things as equal inheritance rights, and so do heterosexual couples living de facto. 

The push for same-sex ""marriage"" has a different motivation - a political agenda, that absolutely insists that homosexuals be regarded as so incredibly important, that society should even redefine our millenia-old institution of marriage to also include them. 

But in reality, the same-sex ""marriage"" issue isn't about ""equality"" at all, it's about RELEVANCE. What is relevant for one group in our society isn't necessarily relevant to another. And there's many examples of this. There's some things that are relevant to women, and not men, and vice versa. There's some things relevant to elderly people, but not young people, and vice versa. There's some things relevant to disabled people, but not able-bodied people, and vice versa. There's some things relevant to normal-sized people, but not midgets. (Midgets are too small to do many jobs for example). In other words, society discriminates all the time, and it's often perfectly relevant to do so. Marriage, by its very nature and essence, is a heterosexual institution, symbolic of an inherently reproductive relationship. It is therefore irrelevant to homosexuals, who have no justifiable claim to it at all, just like bigamists also don't. The push for same-sex ""marriage"" is really about granting homosexuals something they have no logical right to access. It's really about making homosexuals (already a highly favoured, spoiled and pampered minority group due to political correctness), MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS. ",,"",,"",,"",,"",4,"",4
10569,"Many reasons why not","Same-sex marriage should be legalised",3669,124,202,95,1,0,,,,,,,1,529,471,146,"Neutral",1.39,"Reply","RobC, there's many reasons why not. Society already has a definition of what a marriage is, and this is deeply entrenched in our language, culture and way of life. Hence there is a communal interest in preserving this familiarity, just as there is in preserving the alphabet, the numeracy system, the national currency, or the national flag. 

You mention love. Whilst love is obviously a very common motivation as to why people get married (in Western society in the 21st century), love does not define a marriage, and it isn't a prerequisite for marriage. Perhaps you are not aware that 61% of marriages in the world today are actually ARRANGED. Therefore love is probably not a motivation for many of these. Of course love can sometimes fade from a marriage also, but that doesn't mean it isn't a marriage. What defines a marriage is that it is a heterosexual institution, symbolic of an inherently reproductive relationship. 

Of course, bigamists in a 3-way relationship may also claim to love one another, and hence demand marriage rights also. Although most of the advocates for same-sex ""marriage"" remain amazingly silent about advocating marriage rights for bigamists...

During the Howard/ Costello years foreign debt grew at the fastest rate in Australia's history – up by more than $100 billion between 2003 and 2005 alone. 
This is the one part of John Howard’s legacy that nobody in his government wants to talk about: Australia’s foreign debt during his reign. But then nobody else brings it up either.
This is the question every Labor candidate should ask as soon as the economy is mentioned: What was the net foreign debt at the start of the Howard/Costello years? What was it at the end of the Howard/Costello years? And what did John Howard promise to do?
Howard said before the 1996 election that he was concerned about the net foreign debt because:
‘This idea that foreign debt is in some way removed from and remote from the daily lives of Australians is completely false.
If it weren’t for the level of foreign debt, interest rates in this country would be much lower.
And every Australian today who owes money on his or her home is paying a higher interest rate than would otherwise be the case because of the size of our foreign debt.’
And again at his campaign launch speech in February 1996, Mr Howard said this was the most important indicator of a government’s economic credibility. 
He also said at his campaign launch speech:
‘We now owe the rest of the world $180,000 million. Nothing my friends symbolises absolutely and comprehensively more than that disgraceful figure, the total failure of Labor’s economic management over the last 13 years.’
All through the Howard years, despite his rampant rhetoric about the net foreign debt of 180 billion that he was about to inherit from Labor (including the ‘truck stunt’ where he travelled with a large truck with the amount written on the side,), the net foreign debt went up and up, heading past 600 billion and with no infrastructure and no industry to show for it.
In another interview he said ‘I can promise you that we will follow policies which will, over a period of time, bring down the foreign debt . . . our first priority in Government economically will be to tackle the current account deficit.’ - John Howard, Doorstop interview, Debt Truck Launch, 20 September 1995
What actually happened?
Foreign debt was $361 billion at the end of September 2003, an increase of 90 per cent on the September 1995 level. The current account deficit was $11.9 billion at the end of September 2003, an increase of 112.5 per cent on the September 1995 level. - Australian Bureau of Statistics, ABS, Time Series Spreadsheets (Balance of Payments and Investment Position, Australia 5302.0, Reserve Bank of Australia (H) Bulletin, Current Account)

John Howard and Costello knew the problem. But a decade later, Australia's foreign debt had not fallen. It hadn’t stayed the same, increased at the rate of inflation, or even increased at the pace of Australia’s economic growth.
It had blown out to two and a half times the level it was when John Howard took responsibility for the economy.
Export growth had halved from 10.8 per cent under Labor between 1983 and 1996, to 5.3 per cent since John Howard took office. 
After ten years, John Howard became too arrogant to even acknowledge the problem, let alone work on the solution. Everybody said the economy was going ‘gangbusters’. Well it wasn’t. When a country is losing two thousand million dollars a month and has been doing that for the entire term of office of the Howard government then we are listening to spin not living in reality. 
National debt went from a third of GDP in 1996 to more than half when Howard left office in 2007.
Peter Costello had a formula for assessing the burden of foreign debt in 1995. It broke down as $10,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. By the time he left it was well over $20,000 for every man, woman and child in the country.
They were seduced by the revenues from a credit boom. They were so seduced by the tax revenues from the boom that they did not cool it in the period 2000-2006 when it obviously needed cooling. 
There was much crowing about paying off Labor’s government debt of 96 billion. Well it wasn’t Labor’s debt, it was part of Australia’s debt and so was the new 610 billion dollar debt they left. 
Government debt is a good thing if it is spent on infrastructure. Paying off government debt, by selling government assets, as was the Howard/Costello formulae, makes no correction on the balance sheet. Tendering government infrastructure to private companies, who have to borrow money overseas, does not lower the debt either, it just shifts it someplace else. In fact and hardly surprisingly, the federal government can obtain the best interest rate on overseas borrowing. This new type of debt, which we never hear about, may not be Government debt, but it is still a debt owed by the people of Australia. 
The Howard Government’s major economic triumph was to convince voters through the compliant media, that domestic budget surpluses equalled immense economic management, even though monkeys could balance a domestic budget. The monkeys would simply let out less money than they took in; or take in more than they let out, whichever monkeys prefer. And they did. They pretended they were feeding the country economically while bleeding the life out of it. The plea of a generous diet will not hold good against bleeding a man to death.
This is an example of the lies that the Libs get away with 
In this interview by the ABC, Broadcast: 07/07/2009, Reporter: Matt Peacock
MATT PEACOCK: But under the Howard Government, that foreign debt, combined public and private, soared.
The debt that Malcolm Turnbull's truck is now focused on according to economist Ross Gittins is purely the Government's debt.
ROSS GITTINS: Were they to talk about the foreign debt, the Government would say, ""It trebled under your watch."" So they don't want to talk about that. They want to talk about the one that's happened under this Labor Government.
Then Turnbull went on to say this and was not corrected
MALCOLM TURNBULL: The problem with Labor's debt is that they've taken Australia, in a little over 18 months, from being a country which had no debt at all - no debt at all, and cash in the bank, and now we're heading for the biggest debt in our history. And that debt will have to be repaid, the interest on it will have to be paid, and it means, inevitably, higher taxes and higher interest rates. 
That is as big a lie as it is possible to make about Australia’s debt and it went uncorrected, worse still he parroted the same lie day in and day out without anybody telling him he was lying.
The press is complicit. Speaking to Liberal Party members at the party’s Melbourne headquarters around the time of the GFC Mr Howard said it took 10 years for Australia to repay $96 billion in federal debt left when his government came to office. 
This is what he had to say:
‘We can only contemplate the length of time needed to liquidate the $200 billion of debt at the very least our nation now faces as a consequence of recent policy decisions.’ 
‘Malcolm Turnbull (note it was Turnbull as the leader at the time) and his colleagues were absolutely right to oppose the Government’s stimulus package. 
‘It needlessly plunges Australia deeply into debt with a poorly-targeted spending spree.’
Note how it is always ‘Australia’ never the ‘government’. During the Howard years Australia was borrowing money in billions of dollars and we didn’t even know about it. Where was it coming from? 
Well, we didn’t’ have inflation and high interest rates because of a miracle economy.
We had inflation and high interest rates because of an ever spiralling national debt, caused by a never ending trade deficit. Every month the country was losing billions of dollars. Every year Australia’s deficit in goods, services and investment in a quarter could be as high as $15 billion. That is the equivalent of the country borrowing cap-in-hand $15 billion a quarter or $60 billion annually. That happened throughout the great Costello/Howard economic miracle years and nobody even talks about it. The only answer the economic snake oil merchants in the Howard government had after creating a false boom on borrowed money was to mastermind ‘Deregulating’ the labour market; always a code word for lowering wages. That was all they could come up with, in ten years, to stave off high interest rates and our looming foreign debt crisis. Party now, pay later; 1996 =180 billion 2008 = 610 billion (CIA The World Factbook: the entry gives the total public and private debt owed to nonresidents) – the figures speak for themselves. 
Foreign Debt under Labor 		$180 billion
Foreign Debt under Coalition		$610 billion
Increase in debt		$430 billion 
Low wages was their answer. Turn us into Bangladesh. Investment – never. Howard/Costello in their own step-fatherly way, gently took each toddling Australian industry by the hand, led its childish footsteps to the brink of the bottomless pit, and gave it a push, so ending its troubles forever.
Of course they were also selling the farm bit by bit. Assets we already owned were considered assets we no longer needed. Well yes, if we could afford to buy them a second time as with Telstra. Telstra had a return on assets of 20.8 per cent on equity of 32.1 per cent. In its last full year of public ownership, in 1996-97, it paid a dividend to the government of $4.5 billion.
The sale of 49 per cent of Telstra’s equity for $30 billion saved the government about $1.8 billion a year in interest expense – which didn’t justify the loss of 50 per cent of the dividends.
The sale of Telstra did not create wealth, it consumed wealth. 
Major asset sales under the Howard Government totalled $46.1 billion under Hawke-Keating asset sales were around $6 billion.
Howard talked on principle, but acted on self-interest. There was, and still is, much crowing about paying off Labor’s debt of 96 billion. (What they don’t crow about is the fact that retirement costs in unfunded superannuation of the Commonwealth defined benefit scheme was estimated at close to $100 billion at the time the Howard Government left office: up some $60 billion during their reign. Their answer to that one was to close the scheme to new entrants.) Add the unpaid retirement costs to the sale of Telstra and you have the 96 Billion they paid off. This can be found in the same Hansard that Costello crowed about paying off the last of the 96 billion). Nobody ever checks to see what ‘Labor’s debt’ was actually spent on but anybody would think it was spent on an election campaign.
And despite all the talk about leaving a debt for our children to pay off; it is far better to leave them infrastructure with debt than to leave them infrastructure free and debt free. Inflation reduces the burden of debt into the future in the same way we all wish we had gone into debt to buy real-estate in the sixties, seventies or eighties. Think of the Goldfields Pipeline – Perth to Kalgoorlie – at a cost of around £2.5 million. O’Connor, the engineer, was subjected to prolonged criticism by members of the press and also many members of the Western Australian Parliament over the cost of the scheme and he committed suicide as a result, less than a year before it was completed. Today many houses, in Perth, are valued at more than the cost of that great infrastructure that was such a ‘waste of public money’ and it is still providing water to the towns along the way to Kalgoorlie which still produces about 800,000 ounces of gold a year. The pipeline continues to operate today, supplying water to over 100,000 people in over 33,000 households as well as mines, farms and other enterprises.
Why is government debt better than private debt for major works? Let’s say that there is an infrastructure project such as a section of highway that will cost around $5 billion. The project is contracted out and funded by the private contractor. The money has to be borrowed and it will come from the internationally banking system because it is not available in Australia. The ledger shows no increase in government debt but the country has nevertheless incurred the debt. It is necessary to look at foreign debt to find it but it seems nobody looks at that any more. In that fiscal year there is a domestic budget surplus of $5 billion to crow about but that is just deceitful accounting? The money has been borrowed to do a project on behalf of the country in general; it just has not been borrowed in the name of the government. But it is owed by the country in exactly the same way. And the government could have borrowed at the best interest rate.
That type of thinking is now prevalent in Queensland under the Newman government. Sell schools and take the money, then have contractors build new schools and lease them back. The money is still borrowed overseas, but not by the government. We still owe it; we are just not told about it being there on the books. 
You were told that a current account deficit wasn’t a problem because most of it was going into capital goods to increase the productive capacity of the economy. Well we could believe that for one year maybe two years maybe even five years but not twelve years. It is quite obvious that most was going into consumer goods because we don’t manufacture anything.
Clearly, one way to deal with the negative balance of payments would be to increase exports. This, however, requires huge investment in industry, research and development, human capital and infrastructure, urban and freight rail networks as well as ports, on a scale to dwarf what we have seen during the Howard and Costello years, to pull ourselves out of this hole. The investment in manufacturing cannot be left to private enterprise. Nobody is going to mortgage their house and start a shipbuilding industry. There needs to be sizable government investment particularly in freeing up red tape and in the form of tax incentives (which were abolished). It is absolutely essential that we rebuild our manufacturing industry and create decent jobs. 
Instead of slowly working our way to trillions in debt with nothing to show for it, it would have been much better if we had borrowed the money to begin with. Then we could build our lagging infrastructure and rebuild our manufacturing industry. We could buy our way into business; we could buy the technology – the latest Japanese or German machine-tools.
Super funds have done little more with our savings than blow up a housing bubble, much of which could evaporate overnight, especially when the OECD stated that Australian house prices are more overvalued than in any other country.
When there is more money to be made on passive investments like housing who is going to build a factory and go down the risky road of manufacturing?
For industry to compete globally there needs to be Government involvement even if it is in the form of long term low interest loans. Because venture capital is hard to come by businessmen tilt their activities toward short-term projects and the general business mentality comes to view speculation as likely to produce safer gains than investment in projects such as manufacturing that have a long growth period. We need to build factories that are two kilometres long and half a kilometre wide if we are to be competitive.
The workplace, for manual workers, is the most dangerous occupation, not the army, but it isn’t likely that any will be killed or injured doing projects funded by the Liberals since they don’t do any; so they probably don’t have to worry about their record.
THE OPENING RESPONSE TO THAT CLOWN JOYCE SHOULD BE:
‘It is no crime to be ignorant of economics, which is, after all, a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a ‘dismal science.’ But it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance.’

Nobody ever checks to see what ‘Labor’s debt’ was actually spent on but anybody would think it was spent on an election campaign.
And despite all the talk about leaving a debt for our children to pay off; it is far better to leave them infrastructure with debt than to leave them infrastructure free and debt free. Inflation reduces the burden of debt into the future in the same way we all wish we had gone into debt to buy real-estate in the sixties, seventies or eighties. Think of the Goldfields Pipeline – Perth to Kalgoorlie – at a cost of around £2.5 million. O’Connor, the engineer, was subjected to prolonged criticism by members of the press and also many members of the Western Australian Parliament over the cost of the scheme and he committed suicide as a result, less than a year before it was completed. Today many houses, in Perth, are valued at more than the cost of that great infrastructure that was such a ‘waste of public money’ and it is still providing water to the towns along the way to Kalgoorlie which still produces about 800,000 ounces of gold a year. The pipeline continues to operate today, supplying water to over 100,000 people in over 33,000 households as well as mines, farms and other enterprises.
Why is government debt better than private debt for major works? Let’s say that there is an infrastructure project such as a section of highway that will cost around $5 billion. The project is contracted out and funded by the private contractor. The money has to be borrowed and it will come from the internationally banking system because it is not available in Australia. The ledger shows no increase in government debt but the country has nevertheless incurred the debt. It is necessary to look at foreign debt to find it but it seems nobody looks at that any more. In that fiscal year there is a domestic budget surplus of $5 billion to crow about but that is just deceitful accounting? The money has been borrowed to do a project on behalf of the country in general; it just has not been borrowed in the name of the government. But it is owed by the country in exactly the same way. And the government could have borrowed at the best interest rate.
That type of thinking is now prevalent in Queensland under the Newman government. Sell schools and take the money, then have contractors build new schools and lease them back. The money is still borrowed overseas, but not by the government. We still owe it; we are just not told about it being there on the books. 
You were told that a current account deficit wasn’t a problem because most of it was going into capital goods to increase the productive capacity of the economy. Well we could believe that for one year maybe two years maybe even five years but not twelve years. It is quite obvious that most was going into consumer goods because we don’t manufacture anything.
Clearly, one way to deal with the negative balance of payments would be to increase exports. This, however, requires huge investment in industry, research and development, human capital and infrastructure, urban and freight rail networks as well as ports, on a scale to dwarf what we have seen during the Howard and Costello years, to pull ourselves out of this hole. The investment in manufacturing cannot be left to private enterprise. Nobody is going to mortgage their house and start a shipbuilding industry. There needs to be sizable government investment particularly in freeing up red tape and in the form of tax incentives (which were abolished). It is absolutely essential that we rebuild our manufacturing industry and create decent jobs. 
Instead of slowly working our way to trillions in debt with nothing to show for it, it would have been much better if we had borrowed the money to begin with. Then we could build our lagging infrastructure and rebuild our manufacturing industry. We could buy our way into business; we could buy the technology – the latest Japanese or German machine-tools.
Super funds have done little more with our savings than blow up a housing bubble, much of which could evaporate overnight, especially when the OECD stated that Australian house prices are more overvalued than in any other country.
When there is more money to be made on passive investments like housing who is going to build a factory and go down the risky road of manufacturing?
For industry to compete globally there needs to be Government involvement even if it is in the form of long term low interest loans. Because venture capital is hard to come by businessmen tilt their activities toward short-term projects and the general business mentality comes to view speculation as likely to produce safer gains than investment in projects such as manufacturing that have a long growth period. We need to build factories that are two kilometres long and half a kilometre wide if we are to be competitive.
The workplace, for manual workers, is the most dangerous occupation, not the army, but it isn’t likely that any will be killed or injured doing projects funded by the Liberals since they don’t do any; so they probably don’t have to worry about their record.

To exercise power costs effort and demands courage. That is why so many fail to assert rights to which they are perfectly entitled—because a right is a kind of power but they are too lazy or too cowardly to exercise it. The virtues which cloak these faults are called patience and forbearance.

Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), German philosopher.
The supporters of ‘free competition’ or laissez faire would argue that commerce has absolutely no moral obligations at all. And there are those who believed that capitalists hardly ever get together without conspiring against the public good.
The contract between master and servant, between employer and employee has long been known and the method of exploitation has long been understood. Nearly 150 years ago, in John Ruskin’s 1860 Essay, from the Cornhill Magazine 1860, reprinted as ‘Unto This Last’ in 1862, is to be found the best and simplest illustration of the relations of master and servant under the laissez faire system of economy:
‘…We will suppose that the master of a household desires only to get as much work out of his servants as he can, at the rate of wages he gives. He never allows them to be idle; feeds them as poorly and lodges them as ill as they will endure, and in all things pushes his requirements to the exact point beyond which he cannot go without forcing the servant to leave him. In doing this, there is no violation on his part of what is commonly called ‘justice’. …If the servant can get a better place, he is free to take one, and the master can only tell what is the real market value of his labour, by requiring as much as he will give.
This is the politico-economical view of the case, according to the doctors of that science; who assert that by this procedure the greatest average of work will be obtained from the servant, and therefore the greatest benefit to the community, and through the community, by reversion, to the servant himself.
That, however, is not so. It would be so if the servant were an engine of which the motive power was steam, magnetism, gravitation, or any other agent of calculable force. But… on the contrary… It will be done only when the motive force, that is to say, the will or spirit of the creature, is brought to its greatest strength by its own proper fuel: namely, by the affections.
It is not in the master’s interest to pay wages so low as to leave the men sickly and depressed…’
 Ruskin examines the concept of ‘wealth’ – that you can only have rich people if you have poor people. He points out that wealth has two components: material possessions and power. Wealth can consist of how much food, housing, clothing, etc, a person owns. But it is only possible to have an abundance of these if someone will produce them cheaply. The example that he employs is to consider a wealthy landowner. If the other people in his area are also well-off independent farmers, he will have a problem finding workers. If, on the other hand, they are impoverished and landless, he will have no trouble at all getting them to do just about anything for little of no reward. 
The general situation, according to Ruskin, is that if all citizens have a certain level of prosperity it will become increasingly impossible for the wealthy to hire others to work; hence their wealth becomes meaningless as an instrument of power. When we understand his point, it becomes clear that the wealthy have a clear and vested interest in maintaining a certain number of people in absolute poverty.
What this means is that the ‘rising tide lifts all boats’ argument that is often used to justify inequality and the rich getting richer, is simply false. It is meaningless to say that everyone’s income is increasing if disparity between rich and poor is accelerating. 

‘Free competition’ as a system is designed to squeeze the maximum amount of labour from workers while rewarding them as little as possible. In a pure laissez faire capitalist state, there would be no labour laws, no minimum-wage laws, no welfare measures, no environmental laws, no state enterprises and no health laws. 
Ethics cannot be assumed to exist because we live in a so-called democracy with a democratically elected government. Such a democracy only gives each person the right to be their own oppressor and gives the majority the right to oppress the minority, particularly the weak and vulnerable. Majority rule only works, as a system, if ethics and individual rights are taken into consideration. As the saying goes, ‘You can’t have five wolves and one sheep voting on what to have for supper.’
After all, democracy should be a means by which the people come to an accommodation or a collective agreement. Democracy is ‘by, for and with’ the people, to quote Abraham Lincoln, all of them, not just 50% and a bit. 
Unfortunately, the academic economics of university, political parties and certain vested interests still don’t understand the application of ethics, unless of course they are preaching them. In effect, the discipline of economics without ethics is a form of propaganda for a specifically amoral worldview. 
The system which makes cash payment the sole nexus between man and man is not a statement of scientific objectivity, but rather a specifically narrow-minded point of view that is being promoted as if it were a scientific factBeing low paid is hard work—hard work at work and hard work at home making ends meet.
The union cannot convey the anger that burns inside like an underground hot spring trying to become a river. Am idividual has no negotidating power. You, should understand that while we are the lowly working-class—willing, pliable, even sentimental, ever susceptible to brutality, we are not cowardly to the point of servility.

PRICE INCREASES
Increases in the price of EVERYTHING you buy (food, housing, petrol, banking, everything) as companies whack up prices by at least five percent to pay for his paid parental leave scam. Abbott will make up the funding shortfall by slashing services and hospital funding. He will step on the faces of homeless people to frantically thrust $75,000 cheques at women who already drive BMW'S and earn $150,000 a year.  All because they choose to have a baby.

FRAUD
Rampant abuse of the paid parental leave scheme will see rich husbands and wider family members hire accountants to artificially boost the incomes of mums-to-be so they can claim the full $75,000. Any expectant parents will be mad if they don't try to do all they can to inflate their incomes prior to the birth of a child.

Many will offer interest payments in return for temporary loans from family members or friends to be marked as ''income''.

A $150,000 loan ''off the back of a truck'' from a family member as ''income'' can easily be returned in full after the child is born with $15,000 in interest. So mum still gets a clear $60,000. And the lender makes a very nice ten per cent return on a short term loan. 

The stakes and rewards are now so high that any future parent would be insane not to make the most of this FREE money.

Get as much as you can while you can!

Eastern suburbs and north shore mums will no longer talk about property prices at dinner parties. The big topic will be ways to get the biggest baby payment.

Wealthy husbands have the means and ways to ensure their wives get the maximum cash under Abbott's scam. 

GREED STAMPEDE
Those who can least afford it will pay for the unlimited cost of what will quickly become an unprecedented and uncontrollable greed stampede.

As a result taxpayers will pay for a massive,  unforecasted cost blow out of this scheme. 

SCAMS
Watch the shysters start hunting these big pots of government money with bizarre, but quite legal, schemes.

Some will offer single women earning $150,000 per year no strings attached deals in which they source and screen perfect ''Adonis'' males to donate sperm -(outside Australian law even overseas)- so mum can produce a baby to get the maximum bonus. The wealthy mum gets a genetically perfect baby without the ongoing baggage and hassle of a bloke around the house. Tony's scam will create a taxpayer funded generation of fatherless children. Any long term problems or fallout from this can be paid for by the wider welfare system.

INDENTED POVERTY 
PAYS FOR
INDENTED PRIVILEGE
Mum's on no income - who need the most help - will get nothing under this brutal scheme. But they will pay more at the supermarket and everywhere else as companies whack up prices and cut jobs to fund it. Hospitals and a wide range of other services the Liberals deem as unecessary will be brutally cut to fund it.

Abbott will use Federal Parliament to engineer the greatest redistribution of wealth from the poorest to the richest that this country has ever seen. This obscene policy will indent poverty and disadvantage on a scale unheard of in a modern democracy. 

In short your money will be legally ''stolen'' from you so that wealthy women can buy new cars, homes, TV's, etc and pay for overseas holidays. 

SCHOOL FEES SCAM
Many may use the $75, 000 to pre-pay private school or university fees to ensure their child starts life with indented privilege paid for by at least a five per cent increase in prices paid by the poorest of the poor.

Expect to see private schools advertising for their cut of the cash in early 2015.

Entire industries and scams will offer wealthy women ways to spend their taxpayer funded windfalls.

NO NEED TO BUDGET
Such families will never have to consider for a moment that they need to modify their lifestyle or downgrade their spending, or the size of their homes, boats, cars or mortgages to fund their own family. Normal forward family planning and budgeting that have been practised by generations of responsible parents will no longer apply. Tony will make their privilege so much easier to bear and indent it for life.

BABY FOR CASH NOT LOVE
This whole approach will weirdly skew the very reasons for having a child. Child birth will now be based less on pure love and more on Tony's powerful and totally unnecessary financial incentives. 

So vote for Tony and give your money - bucket loads of your money - to people who need it least. 

Don't worry about homeless people, single parents, disabled and the unemployed. They can take care of themselves. That's the Liberal way.

A lower carbon price, controlled by market mechanisms and in line with international standards will keep the costs down, remove any burden the Australian people may have felt under the previous tax (although that is debatable) and, along with the ETS establishing a legal limit on emissions, will replace the current punitive measures which should actually encourage the largest polluters to stick to their reductions.

Admittedly, the effort to cut global emissions by only a single country maybe tiny and Australia is not at the top of the greenhouse gas emission list. But there are reasons for Australia to participate in reducing emission. Firstly, each country is an important cell of the global environment. Nobody can deny that the global warming cannot be relieved until every country, regardless the size, the population and the location, do their job to control emission. Secondly, Australia is more fragile and more sensitive to the change of climate, which is because the relative dependent ecological environment. So Australia should be more active in promote the emission cutting program.
The carbon tax hurts industry.
Although mining industry is so important for Australia’s economic, this industry involves simply consuming our natural resource and with a low technology additional value. We should image what if the coal is used up and at that time the industry would be hurt or even destroyed. The change in industry structure should be taken into consideration; which means Australia should reduce reliance on mining industry.

I agree with the quotations :"" in recent times, the effects of cultural identity and assimilation taken to the extreme in the form of riots, street violence and ethnic gangs on both, the settled and the migrant communities, pose major challenges to multiculturalism in the country.     multiculturalism alleging that it represented ""a threat to the very basis of the Australian culture, identity and shared values"", arguing that there was ""no reason why migrant cultures should be maintained at the expense of our shared, national culture."".  the term ""multicultural"" had been transformed by interest groups into a philosophy that put ""allegiances to original culture ahead of national loyalty, a philosophy which fosters separate development, a federation of ethnic cultures, not one community"". A community of separate cultures fosters a rights mentality, rather than a responsibilities mentality. It is divisive. It works against quick and effective integration, threats to social cohesion,         multiculturalism obscures the social costs associated with large scale immigration that fall most heavily on the most recently arrived and unskilled immigrants.     multicultural policies, and that these policies would put strain on the political system and would not promote better understanding in the Australian community.  multiculturalism threatened to transform Australia into a ""cluster of tribes"".      the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high"" and warned that ""we should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world.   For the millions of Australians who have no other nation to fall back upon, multiculturalism is almost an insult. It is divisive. It threatens social cohesion. It could, in the long-term, also endanger Australia's military security because it sets up enclaves which in a crisis could appeal to their own homelands for help. multiculturalism as ""morally, intellectually and economically ... a sham"".   while multiculturalism might serve the needs of ethnic politics and the demands of certain ethnic groups for government money to be used solely for the promotion of their separate ethnic identity,                         it is a perilous concept on which to found policy.                                        the principle of a multicultural society, asserting that ""multi-ethnic societies are often confronted with the problem of discrimination                                and group conflict."" ethnic homogeneity must be the cornerstone of Australian nation-building. More ethnically homogeneous nations are better able to build public goods, are more democratic, less corrupt, have higher productivity and less inequality, are more trusting and care more for the disadvantaged, develop social and economic capital faster, have lower crime rates, are more resistant to external shocks, and are better global citizens, for example by giving more foreign aid.                                 Moreover, they are less prone to civil war, the greatest source of violent death in the twentieth century. Salter has linked multiculturalism to growing ethnic socio-economic stratification in Australia, stating:

Inequality in Australia increasingly has an ethnic face. Aborigines continue to occupy the lowest rung on the socio-economic ladder. Despite the points system for assessing immigrants, some ethnic minorities have high rates of unemployment and criminality. Many white Australians are losing out to competition from immigrants. Selective public schools show spectacular overrepresentation of Chinese and other Asian students, an imbalance that feeds through to elite universities and thence to the professions. Ethnic socioeconomic stratification is growing as the population becomes more diverse.   multiculturalism forms ""part of an ideological-administrative system that is helping swamp the Australian nation through ethnically diverse immigration.""                                     This, in turn, is ""putting at risk the nation’s ability to produce the public goods that nations excel in producing: relative cohesion and harmony, public altruism, trust, efficient government and political stability."". Diversity is not the only deleterious side effect of multiculturalism. Another is to perpetuate population growth because immigration is part of the quid pro quo offered ethnic minorities in exchange for votes. Perpetual large scale immigration cannot be sustained for well-rehearsed environmental reasons. In the end failure to regulate population growth causes severe suffering and social and economic dislocation. It follows that multiculturalism should be counteracted as part of a responsible population policy. The conflict between the two policies is already evident. The charge of racism is often directed at recommendations for reducing immigration overall, even without changing the ethnic mix.   the current model of multiculturalism is flawed as it excludes Australia's historic Anglo-Celtic majority as a legitimate interest group.",,"",,"",,"",6,"",,"",6

A combination of the different forms of Renewable Energy are far safer, cheaper and use far less water than nuclear.
Nuclear uses nearly as much water as coal does, which is a very large amount and we need to take into account our drying climate for which the very little water that Renewable Energy uses is ideal.
There are no fuel costs for Renewables and because we don't need to mine for fuel, it's a better option for the environment.

Setting aside the validity of the statement, saying ""We don't need nuclear, renewables can do it"" does not present argument against nuclear power. It presents an argument for arbitrarily limiting our energy options to just a few technologies. Limiting our options is the last thing we should be doing right now. We should be using them all in a sensible way. It is so much easier to prove that we ""don't need"" solar or we ""don't need"" geothermal. But that's no kind of argument against using them.

But then you have presented some arguments against nuclear. On water, renewable technology does not, necessarily, use less water. Thermal electricity production, like solar thermal or geothermal, uses water in much the same way as a nuclear or coal plant. Since they are typically in the desert, they would need to use air cooling for the condenser. You could do that for nuclear or coal too, but it's a wasteful use of the generated power.

In Australia, nuclear power would be cooled with ocean water, like the coal stations near Pt Augusta. Most of that water goes back to the ocean a little warmer. It would have no impact to water security. The coal stations in the La Trobe valley... there's your problem. They are stuck in land because they need to be close to so much coal. So they use lots of fresh water (river, reservoir, ground water). Swapping those for ocean cooled nuclear would be really good for water security.

Fuel costs for nuclear are very, very low. It uses hardly any fuel at all. Triple the cost of fuel and the cost of nuclear electricity hardly budges. It's a lot like renewable technology in the economic sense; nearly all the money is spent up front.

A great deal of the materials in renewable technologies are not especially recyclable, and many are very toxic. Since the expected lifespan of nuclear is about 60 years and most RE technology is around 25 years, from a materials perspective RE technology is not that great.

Wind uses no water, solar PV almost no water apart for cleaning the panels. As far as solar thermal using water, at least there is no risk of radioactive contamination of the water being used to generate power as there is with nuclear. There are still problems with locating nuclear along coastlines and using seawater where the large intakes for water suck in a fair amount of sea life. In very hot conditions with a high power demand nuclear power plants can and do pump out overly heated water back into the ocean which affects sea life.

As far as the recycleability of the materials in Renewable Energy technology, can you elaborate on what is not? As far as I have read, they are eminently recycleable with high rates of recycleability. Some may be toxic but if they are reclaimed and recycled, I don't see a great problem. Much of what we use in industrial civilisation is toxic and/or produces toxic byproducts when created and nuclear produces some the most toxic materials on the planet as well as being highly and dangerously radioactive for hundreds and even many thousands of years.

As far as doing a concurrent build of both RE and nuclear together, it is not possible. We will not have the funds or resources to do both. In the short time available to us to reduce our emissions the safest, cleanest, cheapest option is 100% RE.",,"",,"",,"",,"",4,"Misunderstands a point made by the above commenter, which was that disregarding nuclear limits power options overall - not that renewables can only extract a finite amount of power. The argument then seems slightly confused because the (possibly) infinite nature of some resources does not mean some power station can produce huge amounts of power. It is coherent to think a power station might only produce a tiny, but infinite amount of power (over time). However does point out that it is odd to argue along the lines that renewables can also be toxic when we are discusses radioactive substances. Some conclusions are also unwarranted; why are the funds not available for nuclear? ",4

Logically, inferring nuclear is ""too slow"" pre-supposes action by Australia to embark on nuclear prevents other action, be it in renewable energy, revegetation, transport or energy efficiency. This is simply not the case. Even the ""competing"" technologies of wind and solar are not really in competition. Their deployment is not advantaged by the absence of nuclear and would not be hindered by nuclear being under deployment. Logically, if a speedy response to climate change is of interest, the very last thing to do is impose arbitrary limits on actions and options.  If a speedy response is needed, we should be deploying everything.

Factually, nuclear power is the only technology along with hydropower to deliver modern and decarbonised electricity supplies. In terms of roll out, the fastest additions of energy per capita have been from concerted nuclear roll outs, as seen in the figure here http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/programs/energy-and-climate/the-climate-and-environmental-impacts-of-renewables . A single plant may take many years to build, and several can be built concurrently with each delivering huge amounts of energy once commissioned.

Take South Australia. We have put in over 1200 MW of wind in about 10 years, an impressive effort. It has been commissioned incrementally and now delivers about 3500 GWh of electricity (at an average capacity factor of 30%). During the same period, we could have also built two CANDU 6 reactors totaling about 1380 MW.  Once commissioned, how much electricity would they produce? About 11,000 GWh, or three times as much clean electricity as the wind turbine, because their capacity factor would be about 90%.

Is that an argument against the wind turbines? No, not at all. It's an argument to acknowledge that these very different technologies both have different roles and advantages, and we should be using both.

How is this to be judged? Presumably, deaths, injuries, illness?

Malaria? No. HIV/AIDS? No. Tobacco? No. Nuclear power? Not even close.

Air pollution. WHO has estimated air pollution to have been responsible for 8 million deaths in 2012, including over half a million children under 5 years old.

Meanwhile, every credible comparative study returns the same result: nuclear power is safe, irrespective of the assumptions made about the impacts of radiation.

Energy Return on Energy Invested is a massive plus for nuclear power. Wind power consumes more than 20 times the steel and concrete compared to a modern AP1000 nuclear power reactor.

We are used to thinking that the issue is about free energy from the sun versus mining unsustainable uranium but that's a furphy.
The real issue with ""renewables"" is that they are massively resources hungry and require immense amounts of aluminium, copper and concrete for the power distribution and they industrialise our landscape. They wear out in a third the time of the nuclear reactor. PV systems won't even guarantee the copper and aluminium hungry inverters for more than 5 years - where's the renewable sustainability in that!
There is no faster way to a future with clean energy than with nuclear power because no other system uses resources more frugaly. That's been proven in France with a 22 year deployment of their system.

24668,"Nuclear energy should be considered on its merits","Australia should include nuclear power in its future energy mix. ",7978,352,587,25,4,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,4,50,68,32,"Neutral",6.51,"Argument for","Nuclear technology is well developed and offers the modern world both nuclear medicine and nuclear energy.  Unfortunately its tragic unveiling in 1945 in Japan, and with bomb testing in Australia in the 1960's, has created a prejudice against all things nuclear amongst some in our community, making it difficult for them to consider it on its merits.

Today, ANSTO produces 550,000 doses of nuclear medicine in its OPAL reactor at Lucas Heights using uranium raw material.  This is distributed to over 250 hospitals and medical centers around Australia and is used for medical diagnosis and treatment.  The government recently announced $268m funding to expand production reflecting Australia's attitude to ""nuclear"" is maturing. (http://bit.ly/1hLFJF1)

Nuclear energy offers safe (http://bit.ly/1mEJr6a), low emissions (http://bit.ly/1pIq8eq) electricity production with a low environmental impact (http://bit.ly/RRYgso).

Countries which share similar economies, cultures and democratic institutions to Australia have successfully developed nuclear energy industries.  France gets 75% of its electricity from nuclear and has the lowest emissions in Europe.  The USA has 20% nuclear power, the UK 17%.

Prejudices against nuclear energy are slowly dissipating.

Strong and strengthening international anti-weapons proliferation action have been successful in developing civilian nuclear power without technology or materials getting into the wrong hands.  In reality, nuclear power plants are not good for weapons or weapons raw materials manufacture.

There are two main concerns that remain but both are manageable.

Concerns about spent fuel disposal are influenced by images of Homer Simpson and overblown fears of never ending radioactivity.  In truth, spent fuel is comfortably managed around the world aided by the fact there is so little of it.  Australia produces over 1m tons of hazardous waste per year.  We land fill 13m tons of household garbage, amongst 20m tons of waste.  A typical 1 GWe nuclear power plant produces only 18-27 tons of waste per year (http://bit.ly/1t9ewUO) and producers power equivalent to Tasmania's total consumption (http://bit.ly/1og9iSU).  Used nuclear fuel is completely contained and safely manageable (http://bit.ly/1u3Dl3N).   And unlike some toxic waste, radiation dissipates. 40-50 years after removal from the reactor, the heat and radioactivity have fallen to one thousandth of the level at removal (http://bit.ly/1eLJaK4).  After about 1000 years, the amount of radioactivity remaining would be similar to that of the corresponding amount of naturally-occurring uranium ore from which it came.

The other concern is the risk of a major incident.  Fukushima reminded people of this risk.  It remains a tragic event with ongoing cost.  However, no-one died in the nuclear incident at Fukushima and the recent UN report concluded ""No discernible increased incidence of radiation-related health effects are expected among exposed members of the public or their descendants"".  The auto and airline industries saw dramatic reductions in accidents and improvements in safety as they grew and became more prolific.  We should expect the same as the nuclear industry grows - particularly as new modern reactors with passive safety systems are rolled out and replace those built in the 70’s and 80’s.

New reactors are safer than the already safe reactors that have been built in passed decades and the costs of construction will reduce as more are built.

Nuclear power plants are expensive to build but produce low cost electricity for 40-60 years thereafter.  While dependent on uranium fuel, the uranium cost is a relatively low cost component and so electricity costs are stable.  This, along with the zero emissions of a reactor explains why more countries are considering nuclear energy as at least part of their electricity mix.  There is no reason why Australia shouldn't also.

When I read that comment I am surprised. Mostly when people talk about the urgency of action on climate change, we acknowledge the need to spend money. The concept presented here that we must choose to spend only a certain amount of money on only certain technologies. This falls flat for me. As an argument, that can't come from a true concern for cutting emissions. It can only come from a strong interest in using renewable technologies only. I have to return to my first point: how does the climate change challenge benefit from excluding this option?

There is a difference between the two. I would like to point out that Harvey did not once quote the report. He gave his interpretation of it.

Here is a quote. The Working Group III Summary for Policy makers says: 

""At the global level, scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO2 eq are also characterized by more rapid improvements of energy efficiency, a tripling to nearly a quadrupling of the share of zero‐ and low‐carbon energy supply from renewables, nuclear energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), or bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) by the year 2050"" 

The report continues in this tone throughout, treating the low emissions technologies mostly as a collective solution, with some distinguishing between them on page 23. That's a fair approximation of my position: we should deploy everything according to their advantages and disadvantages. 

If we are to respect the IPCC then we need to take their work in its entirety. There are those who maintain the idea that we could achieve a ""tripling of quadrupuling of the share"" of zero carbon energy supply as IPCC prescribes, where the total amount required is itself set to double, without using nuclear power as part of the job.

For me, that is simply so implausible as to be a form of denial and we have to stop toying with the climate future by maintaining this delusion.

I wonder... do you really believe that to be possible? Are you honestly satisfied that you understand the nature of the challenge we face?

I wonder... deep down does nuclear power simply frighten you more than climate change does?

Maybe, just maybe, it's not the bogey man people like Harvey want us to think it is.

Maybe just maybe, the ""untested"" designs Harvey talks about, that use the old nuclear waste as new fuel, that simply cannot melt down, that require no mining for fuel would be something you could find it in yourself to support in the name of climate action?

Harvey is wrong, of course. The designs are mature, and for sale! Why not check out this design and tell me what you think? http://gehitachiprism.com/ .

Are you HAPPY at the prospect of a future run on another fossil fuel when we are supposed to be eliminating them?

Yes, gas in the USA is cheap now and taking a lot of market share.

That need not last. The USA has enforced a ban on selling it to South Asia. If they let the gas be sold on the global market, the price would triple again. This will inevitably happen within a few years.

Thus the true cost of nuclear is (92.5 / 0.9 / 3) = 34.3 [comparative units] relative to wind at (100 / 0.35 / 1) = 286 [cu] Hence, the true cost of wind is about 8 times that of nuclear!
