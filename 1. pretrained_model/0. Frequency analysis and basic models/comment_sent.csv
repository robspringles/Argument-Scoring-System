"Negative gearing may have seemed like a good idea when it was first introduced, but it has become little more than a massive rort. ",MajorClaim
The only reason we still have it after its problems have been pointed out so often is that politicians are under the thumb of the 20% who do most of the negative gearing and have the power to scream the loudest come election time. ,Claim
It has no place in a just and efficient economic system.  ,MajorClaim
The main reason why I agree that negative gearing should be abolished is that it is a major tax break which is largely only available to the wealthy (as unfortunately most tax breaks are). ,MajorClaim

One of the few reasons the non-wealthy can still afford to buy a home is because they can install a tenant to assist with the mortgage repayments. ,Claim
" This is especially true given the workforce is becoming less and less permanent - this offers more choice to employees, but not the stability needed to pay off a mortgage. ",Premise
Regular rent income may be crucial in this regard.,Claim
"Rather than abolishing negative gearing, why not means-test it?",MajorClaim
There's another compelling argument for a mining tax (i.e. against repealing it). ,MajorClaim
We need to somehow put the brakes on the endless destruction of this land and the environment by the mining industry.  ,Claim
I oppose repealing this because the tax will not affect the viability of the resources industry - regardless of what the bleeding heart mining billionaires say. ,MajorClaim
All that will be affected is their share of the spoils.,Claim
"Of course, if they all paid their fair share of income taxes like the rest of us it might change the picture a little - but not much.",Premise
"I don't like Tony Abbott's politics, but as far as I'm concerned politicians can wear what they like; I am more interested in their ideas and their arguments than in how they are dressed.",MajorClaim

I know many people who have investment properties and aren't riched but have used them as a way of saving for their retirement in a way that is more secure than the stock market for example. ,Claim

Let's drop the word tax which implies the divine right of kings to tax their subjects and think of contribution to the common wealth of a democracy.,Claim

The nation as a whole (ie everyone) should benefit to some degree from the minerals.,Claim
Likewise the mining companies that take a risk and make the initial investments are should be rewarded for that risk and investment. ,Claim
The mining tax is structured such that both can occur.,Premise
" It is inequitable that a few should earn more than they can ever need, more than their next three generations of heirs can ever need, from a national resource if the nation as a whole cannot too become wealthier as a whole.",MajorClaim
The minerals are a national resource.,Premise
Not everyone can be a miner or employed in mining. ,Premise

"So we need to make housing more affordable, not less.",Premise
"The ability to negatively gear existing houses makes those houses more valuable and therefore less affordable, and this ability should be abolished.",Premise
" Since so many Australians have so much of their wealth tied up in real estate, this abolition should take place gradually and with plenty of notice.",Premise
"Investment in new, rather than existing, properties should be treated differently.",Claim
"Here the ability to negatively gear probably drives investment, thereby increasing housing supply and driving down cost. ",Premise

 Imagine all the wonderful infrastructure and opportunities Australia could have today.,Empty
"That profits are ""too high to be considered fair"" is confusing - would it be more ""fair"" if miners were less efficient?",MajorClaim
"If ""natural resources belong to the nation"", charge appropriate amounts for mining licenses.",Claim

We need to re-invest into the future of Australian industry rather than 'propping' up our nation by selling off our natural resources.,MajorClaim
"I have worked with some of the mining companies as an external consultant and I witnessed some of the worst penny pinching tactics I have ever come across in business, they are certainly loathe to engage Australian industries.",Empty

not a lot beyond education and now that is being recreated overseas,Claim

Punishment is the wrong way to think about a tax like this. ,Claim
"Such a tax is a contribution to the good of the country, by someone who is temporarily in an unusually good position to so contribute.",Premise
